# Witch loot writeups

## Rod of the Void

This slender rod weighs 2 lbs, and may be wielded as a mace. It
requires PS 12, MD 9 and has a base Strike Chance of 61%. It inflicts
2 rollup D10 and may be thrown ten hexes. When not wielded as a
weapon, it has the appearance of a decorative cane and its weapon
characteristics will not be revealed by Detect Aura.

- It inflicts one point of damage over five seconds to anyone holding
  it as a consequence of contact with the Void. Creatures that are
  older than the universe do not take this damage.

- The Void is considered to be dimensionally proximate to the entity
  wielding it.

- It incrases the wielder's PB by 1 to racial maximum, but if they
  have the distinctive appearance feature, it increases this by
  fifteen.

- Rank in Courtier is improved by one.

## Baba Yaga's Pestle

This heavy mace weighs 7 lbs, requires PS 22, MD 9 and has a base
Strike Chance of 53%. It inflicts one rollup D10 + 5 C Class damage in
melee.

When it is thrown, the mass increases for every hex it passes
through. Thus, for each hex it travels to its target, the damage
increases by one rollup D10 to a maximum of 5 rollup D10. Four more
damage may be added for every 5 PS greater than 22,but bonuses from
Warrior or Assassin do not apply.

Once the Pestle has completed its movement, it returns to the wielder
in an unreadied state. The wielder rolls a D10 at the end of each
Pulse, a 9 or 0 meaning it has become readied.

## Baba Yaga's Mortar

This marble mortar is seven inches in diameter and weighs 55 oz. Once
a day, resetting at noon, and requiring the uttering of a Word of
Power is uttered (Pass Action), it will grow to be five feet in
diameter but with no appreciable increase in weight.
 
It is a legal target for the Instilling Flight spell, improving the
Base Chance by 10, and changing the duration to 30 minutes (+30
minutes per Rank). So long as they maintain at least one hex of
movement per Pulse, they may choose to move at their Tactical Movement
Rate.

Defence versus ranged or melee attacks from below is increased by 20,
and Protection against these attacks is increased by 10.

## Critical Key

This bronze key is chased in silver and weighs 4 oz. It is a magical
lock pick which, if the wielder rolls fifteen per cent or less of
their modified percentage chance, opens it in a Pulse.

## Potion of Longevity

This transparent crystal phial contains a teal potion with swirls of
pearl and weighs 3 oz. Drinking the potion reduces the imbiber's age
by 1 rollup D12 years to a minimum age of thirteen. Taking a one of
these potions subsequently requires a Break 100 + EN roll to avoid
being poisoned. If they avoid being poisoned, then they may make
another age reduction roll as described above. Otherwise, they lose
half their EN, which can only be recovered by Natural Healing, and no
other Potions of Longevity will work for them.

## Potion of Enhanced Restoration

This transparent glass vial contains a grey-green potion with dark
sparkles and weighs 2 oz.  Drinking the potion terminattes the effects
of any potion and restores sixteen FT lost from any cause. It does not
cure poison beyond, perhaps, restoring lost FT.

## Staff of the Woodland

This oaken quarterstaff weighs 3 lbs. It is shod with horn, and living
mistletoe winds around its shaft. It has a base Strike Chance of 67%,
and inflicts base damage of 1 rollup d10 + 5, dealing C-Class melee
damage.

- If the wielder has Rank 5 with this weapon, they may wield it
  one-handed.

- If the wielder attains Rank 10, the base damage increases to 2
  rollup d10 + 5.

- If the staff is wielded by a Druidic spellcaster, the Base Chance of
  all Spells and Rituals they know is increased by 10.

Once per day, the wielder may choose one of the following effects:

Woodland Concealment
: The wielder may use the surrounding woodland to Hide the Tracks of a
  number of entities equal to their Rank in Ranger. This costs 1 FT
  per concealed entity and lasts for a number of hours equal to their
  Rank in Ranger. This concealment requires but a Pass Action.

Tree Form
: The wielder may assume the form of a sheltering rowan tree, 30 feet
  tall with a 30-foot wide canopy. While in this form, they may
  attempt to conceal others beneath their leaves with a Stealth
  roll. Detect Aura will reveal that the wielder is not an actual
  tree.

Spell Surge
: The wielder may increase the Rank of a spell by two. This affects
  its Range, Base Chance, and Damage. This requires a Free Act.

### Investment Properties

The staff is a valid target for the Investment Ritual when storing the following spells:

- Converse with Animals
- Converse with Plants
- Armour of Earth
- Enchanting Plants
- Wall of Thorns

A total of up to twelve spells may be stored in the staff. They cost
the same as if invested in a scroll but are triggered as a Magical
Cast Action on their wielderâ€™s Unengaged Initiative.

Anyone who knows the Investment Ritual and any of the listed spells
may store them in the staff.

## Staff of the Python

This redwood quarterstaff weighs 3 lbs and is shod with bronze. It has
a base Strike Chance of 61% and base damage inflicts one rollup D10 +
4 C Class melee damage.

If the wielder has Rank 5 with this weapon, they may wield it
one-handed.

If the wielder rolls in the range of an A Class Specific Grievous
injury then this is legal, as is a C Class Specifici Grievous injury.

Once a day as a Pass Action, the wielder may throw the staff to the
ground and it will become a massive python eleven yards long and under
their control, which will act on its own Initiative Value. It may be
directed by the wielder as a Free Act, even return it to its staff
form. If the snake dies, then the staff is shattered. Otherwise, it
will be restored to full health the next time it is summoned,
generally speaking.

## Ring of Wound Closure

This brass ring weighs 2 oz, has a flat, lozenge cut rhodochrosite
stone set into a bezel, and must be worn on the left thumb for it to
be effective. Detect Aura will reveal its primary magic is "natural
healing".

Once it has been worn for a week, the bearer reduces the effect of a
bleeding wound by one. This applies to EN loss as a result of falling
below 0.

The bearer recovers EN at three times the normal rate.

## Ring of Water Walking

This ring of pale blue glass has curves carved into the band as of
waves and weighs 1 oz. It must be worn on the least finger of the left
hand.

Once the ring has been worn for a week, the bearer can walk on the
surface of water as if it were solid and non-slip. This effect lasts
for 30 minutes and costs the bearer 3 FT.

They may travel at their normal TMR, however reduce TMR by 1 for every
foot above 3 in wave height. In rough waters, Agility rolls may be
required (unless crawling).

## Amulet of the Blue Pearl

This pearl is set into a silver pin, worn at the throat, and weighs 3
oz. The silver setting costs 100 sp.

Once per day, the wearer may cast the same spell they cast in the
previous Pulse, without needing to Prepare it again.

If the pin is crafted from ithildin instead of silver (raising the
cost to 3,600 sp), the wearer may repeat a spell twice per day instead
of once.

## Figurine of the Silver Raven

This small silver statuette of a raven is 10 cms tall, and weighs 7
oz. It may be called upon once ever other day at a cost of 5 FT, which
may Stun, whereupon it will turn into a large raven of silvery hue at
the owner's feet and serve them for twelve hours. It is about the size
of a turkey.

It is friendly to its owner, understands their language and obeys
spoken commands. If not instructed, it will defend itself but take no
other action. It can be returned to its figurine form by utterning a
Word of Power (requiring a Pass Action).

It may be directed to an entity that the owner knows and that is close
enough for it to fly to. It will deliver a short, simple message and
then fade away.

solvent, which may be used to annihilate 1 cubic foot of any normal
material and most exotic materials. This will take twelve Pulses.

This cloak weighs 2 lbs, and as a Free Act, the wearer may change its
cut, colour, style or apparent fabric. It can appear to be a coat with
pockets but these are non-functional.

condeensed might of a Storm Giant.

3    2    1

The PS of whoever drinks this becomes 55, they increase their melee or
close rated damage reduction by 6 and they add 1 D10 to their Melee
and Close weapon damage. This lasts for 6 Pulses. Drinking from the
flask empties it until after the next dawn.


## A Topacious Stone

This dull, yellowish stone contains several inclusions and weighs
approximately 9,237 carats. It is shaped like an oblate sphere
measuring about 10 cm in diameter.

An artisan gem-cutter or lapidary can transform it into a brilliant
faceted canary-yellow gem according to the following table:

Rank   Carats     Value (sp)  Diameter

# Dragon, Balrog and Ophanim loot

## Phantasmal Crown

This appears to be a crystal diadem but is, in fact, an organ ripped
from the body of a creature not known to mortal men. It weighs 2
lbs. If it is worn then it provides the following bonuses:

+5 to the Base Chance of any spell that creates a force or object of
Phantasmal nature (Phantasm, Flash of Light, Illusion of Food, Static
Illusion, Personalisted Illusion, Illusionary Wall, Illusionary
Cloaking, Illusory Fog, Illusionary Animal, Illusionary Bolt, Illusory
Creation, Disguise Illusion, Illusionary Euphonia, Illusion of
Metamorphosis, Hallucination, Heroism, Illusion of Innocence, Maze,
Illusion of Metamorphosis, Illusion of Mist, Illusion of Multiple
Images, Nightmare Illusion, Illusionary Aura, Illusionary Terrain).

When cast upon the wearer, Heroism will stack with the Force Shield
spell, and the duration of both is tripled.

When the wearer Casts Mind Shield, in addition to its other effect,
the spell reduces damage to Willpower by 1 + 1 for every Rank that is
prime. At Rank 20, one more point is reduced.

The wearer receives one less point of magical damage but not damage
inflicted as a consequence of a Strike Check.

## Dragon's Teeth Ã— 63

Each of these teeth weigh an oz and there are 63 of them. They may be
sown on a battlefield, whereupon each will grow into a warrior with
the following stats:

\begin{statstbl}{}
PS: 20   &  MD: 18  &   AG: 15 &    MA: 10  &   EN: 24   &  FT:     23 \\
WP: 20   &  PC: 18  &   PB: 12 &    TMR: 5  &   NA: 5
\end{statstbl}

\begin{statstbl}{}
Attack     &    IV  &    SC  &   DM  &   Class     &  Use &  Rk \\
Battleaxe  &   40   &  109\%  &   +6  &   B class   &  8   &  7 \\
Lg Rd Shld &    37  &   68\%  &   +2  &   C class   &  M   &  4 \\
\end{statstbl}

Their Defence is 35 and their Magic Resistance is 40%.

The warriors will fight loyally under the command of whoever sowed
them, always succeeding when forced to make a morale check but will
last no longer than a minute.

It takes a Pass action to sow the dragon's teeth, and as many as
(Military Scientist Rank - 2) may be sown on any given day. The teeth
may be sown in one action or one at a time.

## Balrog Fork

The fine spinal segments of the balrog may be fashioned into a weapon
that will collapse down and lock into a form somewhat like a
trident. It is 7 feet long and weighs 5 lbs. The three tines are
barbed and when unlocked, allow the wielder to use their MD to grab at
things. Fine manipulation is not possible.

The fork is considered a 1 or 2 handed pole weapon. The base Strike
Chance is 61%, the base damage is 2 rollup D10 + 3, inflicts A, B or C
Class damage, and provides an Engaged Initiative Value bonus of 12.

The wielder may take a Free Act and change the properties of the
weapon, so that it is a long, flexible chain weapon with a claw-like
appendage. This will reach up to 5 hexes away, and may deliver an
attack or grab something about the size of a human limb or head.

In this form, the base Strike Chance is 47%, the base damage is 1
rollup D10 + 5, and the weapon inflicts B or C Class damage. If a grab
is attempted, the wielder must successfully Strike the target and make
a 3 Ã— MD check - distance in feet. Those grabbed by the weapon may
attempt to shrug it off by attempting a withdraw from Close combat
manoeuvre.

The weapon is Ranked as a Lasso, the PS minimum to wield is 14 and the
MD minimum is 18.  Strike Chance increases according to the following
schedule:

Rank           0    1    2    3    4    5    6
---            ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---
+SC            0    +2   +3   +5   +7   +11  +13
Cumlative +SC  0    +2   +5   +10  +17  +28  +41

## Balrog Tail

The cord from the balrog's tail may be extracted to make a whip which
extends out fifteen feet and weighs 3 lbs.

The base Strike Chance is 47%, base Damage is 2 rollup D10. If the
Strike Check result is a prime and a successful Strike, the whip
cracks for an extra rollup D10 damage.

The hand wielding the whip has its MD increased by 16 and the wielder
may extend their sense of touch down its length.

Bonuses to PS do not increase the damage of this weapon.

## Balrog Scale

The cracked and friable hide of this balrog has formed into irregular
but horn-like scales. Each is about 2 centimetres thick, are vaguely
half-moon shaped, and vary in size from 1 foot by 18 inches to 2 feet
by 3.

They may be made into bucklers, small round or large round shields of
the following properties:

Shield                Weight     DEF per Rank     MD penalty
---                   ---        ---              ---
Buckler               1.5 lbs    3%               0
Sml Rd Shld           2.5 lbs    4%               -1
Lg Round              5 lbs      5%               -2

## Balrog Claws Ã— 8

These claws may be shaped into blades that will not allow a hilt to be
attached. Magical throwing knives can be made from them, with the
following base properties:

Strike Chance: 53%, Damage: roll D10. 1 - 4 = 5 damage, 5 - 7 = 10
damage, 8 or 9 = 15 damage, 10 = 20 damage. The daggers inflict A or B
Class damage and their maximum range is 12 hexes.

Once they have been thrown, they turn to smoke and stream back to
their sheath, which takes about 3 Pulses.

## Balrog Spurs Ã— 2

These curved, hornlike blades are 19 inches long and have a reverse
blade like a cat's claw. They may not be thrown, but may be wielded as
magical daggers and they have otherwise normal properties, except that
they inflict A or B Class damage.

If wielded together, then the wielder is considered ambi-dextrous,
their base Strike Chance is 47% and base damage is 2 rollup
D10. However, Strike Chance is increased by 7 per Rank instead of 4,
and if one dagger misses, then it will deliver a FT blow. If the
Strike Check is successful and it is a prime number, the spur
detonates for an extra rollup D10 damage.

If both miss, nothing special happens.

## Balrog Sinews

The sinews may be woven into a fine but incredibly strong line which
has a breaking strain of 2 metric tonnes. It is 90 feet long, and
weighs 3 lbs.

If the user takes a Pass Action, the line will turn to a wispy thread
of smoke and pour itself into a pouch, which will take about a Pulse.

## Balrog Eyes

These transparent, watchful, oval crystals of red and black may be
enchanted with the Create Crystal of Vision Ritual. Once a day, it may
be used as a Crystal of Vision or as if a Ritual of Flame Sight had
been successfully performed, but not both.

Infravision and Pyrogenesis may be used through the crystal, range
counting from the point of view.

## Balrog Teeth Ã— 60

These teeth are very hard, and each one weighs half a pound.

They may be thrown to the ground and crushed under heel. This has a
chance of 83%, which may double, triple, or backfire. The following
Pulse, a Rank 20 Wall of Fire will spring up centred on the crushed
tooth, but having the proportions that the user wishes as outlined by
the spell (Section 21.6 S-13).

## Eyes of the Ophan

### The Eye of Reformation

This eye is an opal in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. Until it is used, it sheds a
green light out to about three metres in a cone about 30 degrees
wide. If the bearer plays the light on an entity with MA for a minute,
it will have its personality changed, if it is holy or unholy, to the
opposite, which will exhaust it.

### The Eye of the Exquisite

This eye is a pearl in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. Until it is used, it sheds a
nacreous light about the wearer. A viewer who considers the race and
gender of the wearer sexually appealing will adore them if they are
within two metres when it is used. Normally, there is no Resistance to
this effect.

This eye may be recharged if the wearer plucks out their own eye and
places it in the bezel before the next dusk, dawn, noon or midnight.

A figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
-1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. In addition, they reduce
their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by 30.

Any attempt to regenerate the organ lost in this way will fail unless
2,500 Experience is paid to the Eye of the Exquisite.

### The Eye of Departing in Safety

This eye is a sapphire in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. The sapphire protrudes
noticeably from its setting.

When held in a fist and a Magical Fire Action is performed, it
unleashes searing blue rays of light at up to 1D12 entities or objects
of up to size 6 that are in direct line of sight and within 300 feet.

The Eye has two possible uses.

If a destination was previously stored in the Eye (a process that
takes one hour), all targeted entities/objects and the Eye itself will
instantaneously travel to that location. This teleportation can be
blocked if the path is obstructed by Bound Earth or Cold Iron.

If no destination is stored, the targets and the Eye are instantly
consigned to an "illimitable darkness", never to return.

Upon arrival, the user must pluck out an eye immediately to recharge
the device. If this is not done, the Eye of Departing in Safety
becomes permanently drained and useless.

Regardless, the Eye cannot be used again until the next Dark of the
Moon has passed.

A figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
-1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. In addition, they reduce
their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by 30.

Any attempt to regenerate the organ lost in this way will fail unless
5,000 Experience is paid to the Eye of Departing in Safety.

### The Eye of Undersight

This eye is a larimar in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. The stone is translucent,
milky, and contains bluish swirls.

The bluish swirls are visible and will attend the bearer for as long
as it is not used. They are separately detectable in their aura and
may be interrogated by such entities as are wise in these matters.

Detect Aura will reveal it as magical, and the nature of the magic
being to do with revealing things.

When it is used, it projects a cone of silvery light with an internal
angle of 30 degrees and that extends for 36 metres. Any entity or
object concealed by shifting planes or any dimensional threshold (but
not boundaries) not normally visible will be revealed by this
light. Entities or objects concealed by illusions or other means are
not revealed. Using it will exhaust the Eye.

### The Eye of Kra of the MenninkÃ¤inen

This eye is an unworked piece of amber in a lenticular orichalcum
bezel about three centimetres long and weighing four ounces.

When it is used, the Eye ignites with red, yellow and orange flames,
and can be used to pull objects that weigh less than 1,000 lbs and
that are within a hex towards the user, or push them away that
distance. Doing so drains the user's PS by one for each Pulse it is
active. PS lost in this way recovers at a rate of one every three
days.

When the user stops paying the PS cost, the Eye becomes inactive and
if the bearer does not pluck out their eye by noon so as to recharge
the sliver of amber, the Eye will be permanently drained. In any case,
it may not be used for until after noon of the next Sunday.

A figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
-1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. In addition, they reduce
their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by 30.

Any attempt to regenerate the organ lost in this way will fail unless
1,500 Experience is paid to the Eye of Kra of the MenninkÃ¤inen.

## Disruptor Cannon

This complex device weighs 1,200 lbs, and is supported by an armature
that is made from antimony-hardened lead and bronze. Planes of
transparent glass in shades of red and yellow, are attached by slender
quills of Gla'aki to gears and wheels which rotate around a narrow,
central(ish) column the width of a dragon's eye. From this, at an
angle of 89 degrees, a barrel made from a metal that is the colour of
headaches and nausea extends as far as a healthy man in the prime of
his adulthood can urinate. Every time the device is touched, it drains
1 FT, but if touch is sustained, will not drain for another five
minutes.

A Mechanician who has learnt Glassworking, Chronometers, Fine
Materials. Spell Containment, Siege Weapons and Experimental
Engineering (Energy Weapons) may repair this weapon which will cost 15
guineas. A Mechanician who can teach Experimental Engineering (Energy
Weapons) will charge like a wounded bull and likely involve Greater
Summoners. The material value of the Emitter alone is 300 guineas.

When it is repaired, it may be used to deliver siege damage to a
target 1000 hexes distant. Damage attenuates after each 100 hexes by
one. Energy shields are twice as effective against Disruptors,
although force shields are ignored.

There is space for three human-sized entities to operate the weapon,
one of whom aims and fires the weapon. The weapon draws 50 FT to power
the weapon which can came from any or all of the three in any
proportion. The Gunner's Rank in the Disruption Spell determines the
Cast Chance and base Siege Damage of the Disruption effect is 1 rollup
D10 + Rank, which destroys the bonds between molecules in the area of
a megahex. If the Gunner's Rank is 15, an extra rollup D10 is rolled,
and a final one at Rank 20.

Once fired, the cannon will be unready for three Pulses.

A cube of basalt five foot on a side has around 50 Siege points.
