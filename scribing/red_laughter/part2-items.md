# Existing Items and Abilities

##  Spell Matrix

A Spell Matrix takes 7 half days of magical training to create.  They
must also expend Experience to create each of them.  The base cost for
a spell matrix is 1000 Experience divided by (the Adept's MA - 15).
If the Adept has less than 16 MA, they cannot create spell matrices.
The cost doubles for each new matrix bought.  There is no upper limit,
the Adept can keep buying matrices so long as they are willing to
spend the Experience.

Incantations of a spell must be racked before they can be cast by the
Adept. To rack a spell, the Adept must ritually cast it with its
particular incantation. If the spell cannot be ritually cast, it
cannot be racked.

# Points and Pools

## Clarity

Three Sanity may be converted to one Clarity during Purification which
may be spent as a Free Action to make sense of gathered information.
It cannot be used to collect information, per se, but provides an
opportunity to make sense of information that is confusing or to
winnow out deceptions.

As a Free Act, Callas may elect to penetrate an Illusion by spending
Clarity with her Enhanced Vision Talent, and, if successful, see the
underlying reality.

She may also cure mental illnesses, diseases, wounds or injuries by
adding Clarity to an attempt to Heal according to, but not limited to,
the following schedule:

Rk    Effect
---   ---
1     minor phobia, minor addictive habit
2     obssessive disorders (hand-washing, Tourettes Syndrome, compulsive tics), attention deficit
3     minor depression or mania, gluttony, sexual perversion, compulsive hoarding
4     inappropriate emotional response, delusions of grandeur, major addictive habit
5     hallucinations, hysteria, confused identity, major phobia
6     homicidal mania, clinical depression, fits & convulsions
7     epilepsy, paralysis of limb, hysterical loss of sense(s)
8     periodic catatonia, grand mal epilepsy
9     permanent catatonic state, coma
10    vegetative state


## Green Pool

Tulip has a pool that reflects her access to the Green, a wellspring
of the mystic power of plants and creatures of the natural world. The
DM may award her Green points for defending creatures and plants of
the wild, the environment the passage of the seasons or when she
undergoes a change that reflects the cycles of natural forces.

* She may spend these points to override her normal physical limits or
to manifest connections to beasts and plants.

* She can spend Green to boost any of stats except FT and MA at a rate
of one for one, but this will last only for a Pulse and is executed as
a Reflex Action.

* By taking a Free Act and spending 5 Green, she may employ a Feral
Strike and subtract 10 from her Strike Chances, her Melee or Close
damage being doubled for the rest of the Pulse.

* She may make one (only) extra opportunity when attempting to escape
from being held or grasped at a cost of one Green.

* She may take a Pass Action and spend one Green to improve or worsen
the reaction of a natural creature by ten, but this cannot modify a
value lower than 05 or higher than 95. This also applies to results on
the Fright Table.

* She may take a Pass Action and spend three Green so that she is able
to move at 1/3rd (truncating all fractions) of her TMR or movement
rate when she casts Blending on herself.

* All Green are are restored after Purifying on the next Dawn, however
all unused Green are lost at midnight of the Equinox or Solstice end
of season festivals.

## Wild Pool

Three Green may be converted into one Wild after Purifying.

Wild represents untamed, primal power—deep instinct, animal cunning,
or natural ferocity that lies beneath conscious action.

* While her Wild pool is not empty, she subtracts 5 from the result of
  any Herbalist or Ranger Check made in a natural environment.

* At a cost of one Wild, Tulip may make one (only) additional attempt
  to resist magic or Skill use that Fears, Calms, Controls, Compels,
  Binds or Hypnotises her.

* At a cost of one Wild, Tulip may invoke Cobra Strike and win
  Initiative.  However, she can only use this when her opponent is
  within her Melee or Close range and she is using natural weapons.
  Cobra Strike is faster than any "automatically win initiative"
  ability, except when executed by someone who also has it and has
  more (MD + PC) as well.

* Tulip may heal herself of damage, excluding the special damage of
  Specific Grievous injuries, Drain and burns by spending up to three
  Wild from dawn to dawn. If she spends one Wild, she may use it three
  times over that period, each use restoring 1 rollup D8. If she uses
  two Wild in one of her uses, she restores one rollup D8 + one rollup
  D10. If she uses three Wild in one use for that period, she restores
  one rollup D8 + one rollup D10 + one rollup D12. This is executed as
  a Free Action.

* Wild persists beyond the end of season festival, but is never
  restored once spent.


## Doom Pool

Black Archibald has a pool that contains Doom. Every time the DM
believes he has performed an act or decision that leads to the
utterance "Aye, they werre doomt!" in a dour Scots accent or that
points out the inexorable march toward some final destiny, they may
award him one or more Doom points at the end of each session of play.

### Spending Doom

Doom points may be spent to channel the dark inevitability of his
destiny, resist opposition, or for specific uses as listed below:

Doom-laden Blow (Free Act)
: As a Free Act, Archibald may spend one Doom to make his melee attack
harder to avoid. If he misses, then he gets another attack at half his
Initiative Value, if this misses, then he gets another attempt at half
that value, and so on until the value falls below ten. He may use
Doom-laden Blow before, during or immediately after his first attack.

Imposing Presence (Reaction)
: By spending five Doom, Archibald may impose an aura of inevitability
and dread upon enemies within his front hexes.  Effect: This effect
last until the end of the Pulse, but for the duration, those who are
affected add fifteen to the die roll results of their percentile
checks.

Doom-Fueled Strength (Free Act)
:  Archibald can spend Doom to enhance his prowess for his next
attack.  Spending Doom increases the damage of his next attack by
three. This must be declared before the attack roll.

Curse Avoidance (Free Action)
: By channeling Doom, Archibald may resist effects that attack his
destiny, so can improve his resistance to Curses at a rate of 5% per
point spent. In the event of a Death Curse, he may spend Doom to Break
100 + WP to successfully Resist.


### Doom Pool Mechanics

Restoration
: All Doom is fully restored after Purification at dawn but is lost at
midnight during the end-of-season festival.

## Certainty

Three points of Doom may be converted to one Certainty during
Purification. Certainty is a finite resource that persists beyond the
end-of-season festival but cannot be restored once spent.

### Spending Certainty

Certainty points represent Archibald’s absolute conviction and control
over the forces of inevitiblilty. They may be spent in the following
ways:

Supreme Resolve (Free Action)
: Certainty may be spent to completely negate the effects of Fear,
Terror, or Horror without the need for a roll.

Weaving Reality
: By spending Certainty, Archibald may alter events to align with his
goals (e.g., finding a hidden escape route, encountering an ally in
dire circumstances).

The cost of this depends on the significance of the effect, with minor
influences costing 1 Certainty and major narrative changes costing up
to 5. In addition, he adds that amount to all of his percentile die
rolls until he finds a way to remove this penalty.

# Henry the Toymaker

## Second Head of Abzazu

Range
: Self

Duration
: 10 minutes (+ 10 minutes per Rank)

Base Chance
: 30%
Cast Time
: 10 minutes

Effects
: This spell manifests as a second head that appears on the caster’s
shoulders, wearing a great helm and resembling an intimidating,
ancient visage. The second head provides a bonus of 10 (+1 per Rank)
to notice hidden details, subtle sounds, or movements. Black Archibald
may sing in intervals, improving their skill at Singing by three
Ranks.

If he is the victim of a blow to the head, then he has a 50% chance
that it has affected the Second Head, which will be destroyed by it,
and thus dissipate the spell. Only the Specific Grievous damage will
be voided by this means, the rest being applied to Archibald.

The second head also allows him to maintain concentration on one
additional effect.

## The Sandglass of Polycarpus

This small sandglass will measure the passage of three minutes in tiny
grains of jade whenever it is turned over.  It weighs thirteen oz and
is made from turned quartz and an extremely hard, marbled, dark blue
metal. It is unusually heavy.

The bearer may store Magical Pass Actions in the sandglass by reducing
their maximum FT value. This is done by Purifying with the sandglass
at dawn.

If one Magical Pass Action is to be stored, then the bearer's FT value
is reduced by one. If two Magical Pass Actions, then their FT value is
reduced by an additional two, if three, then an additional four.
Obviously, the amount FT value is reduced doubles for each Magical
Pass Action stored.

Only one Stored Magical Pass Action may be used in a Pulse, but it may
be combined with any other Action the bearer has available.

The bearer may begin to recover FT value as if recovering "tiredness"
FT once all of the Magical Pass Actions have been exhausted.
Subsequent Magical Pass Actions cannot be added to the sandglass until
it is empty.  It is also
a [Spell Rack](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Spell_Rack).

## Figurine of the Diorite Mount

This rough-hewn stone figure is very nearly black with speckles of
almost luminescent white.  It appears to be a clumsy sculpture of a
horse, being ungainly and graceless. It will fit into the palm of a
large man, and weighs thirty one oz.

If a point of power is sacrificed to the figurine, then a mount may be
stored therein.  Once in any twenty four hour period, the mount may be
released from it. Storing or releasing the mount requires a Pass
Action.

# Ogre Magi

## Talisman of Water

This small bracer is made from the amber hide of a giant seahorse and
a translucent blue gem about the size of a hen's egg. The stone has
whorls scratched into the surface and is poorly polished. It weighs
eight oz.

On the first day of each season, the wearer may store a number of
General Knowledge Water College spells into the gem which is equal to
their Rank in the General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of
Water Magic, and a record taken.

The Rank of the spells stored in the talisman are the same as their
Rank in the General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Water
Magic.  It is also a [Spell Rack](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/).

## The Horse Shoes of Ishkur

These shoes are made from the bones of nephilim. Typically, only four
of them may be worn at one time, and although they can be swapped out,
the magic of new ones take a week before they start working. When a
shoe is removed, it immediately stops working.

### Shoe of the Horn

Grants the ability to project a yard long illusory horn of shadows; 
The mount can:
- make a Presence attack with a base bonus of 15% and cause Fear
- dispel an illusion by touch once per day.

### Shoe of Robust Health

Improves reslience and resistance to disase
- +10 to Resist Disease
-  multiplies the amount of EN recovered from Natural Healing by 5

### Shoe of the Transformation

Improves the duration of a shape change

- multiplies the duration of a shape change by 12
-  provides one extra shape change per day

### Shoe of the Dark Flames

Leaves a trail of hoof prints that burn with dark flames where the mount has passed

- once a day, the mount (and rider) become shadowy and return to where
  it started in the previous Pulse so long as they traveled overland
  and by their own means.

### Shoe of the Thunderer

Increases the amount of damage of any kick or trample by 1 D10 and all are rollup dice.

- once per day, the mount can deliver a Charge attack that is
  perpendicular to their facing. This allows the mount to attack every
  1 hex (or less) creature in every hex that it passes through up to
  its full TMR, and this is considered a Trample.

- after rearing, the mount can deliver an attack to every creature in
  their front facing hexes. Unless their opponent is a multi-hex
  creature, this is resolved as an attack rated for Close but carries
  a 20 point penalty to Strike Chance.

### Shoe of the Herd

Creates multiple images of the mount and rider. This can only be used
once a week, and resets on a Friday at dawn. Either

- create six other illusory copies of the mount (and rider) which will
  never travel further than five hexes from the mount

or


- create a single illusory copy of the mount (and rider) which can be
  directed to travel up to seven leagues away. It cannot fight or
  perform magic but it can speak simple messages.

### Shoe of Nightfall

This shoe can only be used once a month, resetting on the third night
of the Dark of the Moon.

- call night from horizon to horizon, taking half an hour

## Proscenium Wand

Range
: 120 feet

Duraction
: Concentration max. 10 minutes

Cast Chance
: 40%

This crystal wand is 17 inches long and streams with rainbow colours
when it is being used. The wielder adds their MA over 15, WP over 15,
half their Rank in Troubadour and Enchantment to the base Cast Chance.

It holds three charges.
3    2    1

Discharging a charge creates a visible phenomenon that is no larger
than 20 feet by 20 feet by 10 feet, and any dimension less that five
feet is considered to be five feet.

The image appears at a visible spot within range and lasts for as long
as concentration is maintained, or ten minutes, whichever is
least. The scene will seem real and include appropriate sounds,
smells, and temperature. Damage can't be created with this magic, but
it can be used to create visual impairments, distracting sounds and
distressing smells as if the magic were Rank 10. (Smoke Creation,
Create Fog, Noxious Vapours, Ethereal Orchestra, Audile Illusions.)

Creatures or objects in the area of effect can be moved or modified to
reflect behaviour. For example, a creature could be made to appear to
walk or talk, although the area of effect cannot be moved. Physical
interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
things can pass through it. If a creature discerns the illusion for
what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other
sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

If the wielder Purifies with the wand in the hour before true Dawn,
then they roll a D10. If the result is a prime, then a charge is
restored.

## Copper Nails × 6

If this copper nail is driven into the foot print of a witch, Wiccan
or hag, then they will lose 1 TMR. They will also leave bleeding
footprints unless they take time to bandage their feet.

## Sedan Chair

This sedan chair is fully enclosed with silken curtains, is eight feet
long, two yards wide and five feet high. It will fold down into a
cylinder of enchanted wood and silk one yard long and six inches
across. It is large enough to seat 19 sizes of humanoids, yet only
weighs 25 lbs. It provides 8 Protection and 20 Defence to passengers
with respect to physical attacks from below.

A small, pintle-mounted ballista is placed at the right hand rear
corner of the chair, which fires javelins as if they were Heavy
Crossbow quarrels, inflicting 2 rollup D10 + 5 A Class missile
damage. There is no PS requirement to wield the ballista, but it takes
five Pass Actions to reload it, less 1 for every five points of PS in
excess of 20, minimum 1.

It is a legal target for the Instilling Flight spell, but with these
distinctions:
* the duration of the spell is 30 minutes (+30 minutes per Rank)
* if the Adept travels in excess of their TMR, then their Magic
  Resistance and Defence is reduced to zero (+25 for flying and
  movement).
* they may slow down from or speed up to the maximum speed so long as
  they maintain at least one hex of movement per Pulse.


## Trident of Frost and Mist

The tines of this trident were made from the tooth of a sea serpent
from the frozen north, set into golden brown larch wood.It has a faint
scent of grapefruit when it is warm or held for a time.

The base Strike Chance is 53%, requires PS 13 and MD 17 and may be
wielded one- or two-handed. It weighs 3 lbs, and inflicts damage
according to its prime, thus:

Result	Damage
---		---
1		2
2		3
3		5
4		7
5		11
6		13
7		17
8		19
9		23
10		29

To this is added 4, plus any bonuses for excess PS (to a maximum of
+4), bonuses for Rank and bonuses to Strike Chance and damage from the
Weapon of Cold spell (only). In the event of a Strike Check that is 5%
or less and a Possible Specific Grievous injury result that is greater
than 20, then another Possible Specific Grievous injury is rolled. If
this is also greater than 20, then a final roll is allowed.


If a spell of Ray of Cold is ritually cast into the trident, which
will require the Adept seethe ambergris in walrus milk, then it will
be stored therein. This process will cost as much as if the spell were
Invested into a scroll. The trident can hold eight charges of this
spell. The user adds their MA bonus, any Aspect bonus and Enchantment
to the Cast Chance, not the investors.

When the spell is released, requiring a Fire Action, the user may
spend two charges and cast the spell over a conical volume of effect
that it is 15 feet long (+15 for every two Ranks) and 5 feet wide (+5
feet per Rank)

The trident can hold eight charges.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1 
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

If a spell of Gaseous Form is ritually cast into the trident, which
will require the Adept add natrium to lamprey oil and stand well
clear, then it will be stored therein. This process will cost as much
as if the spell were Invested into a scroll.  The trident can hold
three charges of this spell.  The user adds their MA bonus, any Aspect
bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance, not the investors.

--- --- ---
3   2   1
--- --- ---

Both processes are noisome, and require a laboratorium that is remote
from decent folk, lest they take up arms for the remedy.

# Library of Alexandria

## Ritual of Enchanting Crystals

Range
: 10 feet (+5 feet / Rank)

Experience Multiple
: 300

Base Chance
: 75% + 1% / Rank

Cast Time
: 1 hour

Effects
: Callas can enchant a crystal into a Crystal of Vision of equal Rank.

Callas can add Clarity to a crystal which will make it at least
translucent and likely transparent, improve it's gem qualities, and if
it has been made by the Gem Creation spell, will change its duration
to Immediate.

In addition, she may store visible memories by enchanting crystals according to the following schedule:

Rk    Effect
---   ---
1     store a static image (object or entity) in the crystal.
3     store the image of an entity
5     store the image of a scene
7     project a static image stored in the crystal
9     project the image of an entity stored in the crystal
11    project the image of a scene stored in the crystal
13    animate the projected static image stored in the crystal
15    animate the projected image of the entity stored in the crystal
17    animate the projected image of the scene stored in the crystal
18    make a static image stored in the crystal real for one minute, destroying it
19    make the image of an entity stored in the crystal real for one minute, destroying it
20    make the image of a scene stored in the crystal real for one minute, destroying it


## Callas' Arresting Gaze

Range
: 10 feet (+5 feet / Rank)

Duration
: Special

Experience Multiple
: 300

Base Chance
:  Automatic

Cast Time
: Magical Fire Action

Effects
: This magic does not normally miss, and neither can it generate
Double or Triple Effects. Callas has a gaze that she can fix on an
entity or an object that can fit inside a volume of one hex (+ one hex
for every ten Ranks). Objects or entities of greater size cannot
normally be affected.

The effects of the gaze are Avoided or Opposed, not Resisted, and if
this is done, then nothing happens to them. For a target that
succumbs, however, the current Pulse does not end for them. They do
not lose Actions directly, however, abilities that reset at the end of
the current Pulse or the beginning of the next will not be renewed as
the Future is warded away from them. Similarly, entities afflicted
with continuous damage like bleeding wounds, Greek Fire, poison, the
End of Pulse Stun Recovery check, etc. will no longer experience them
until She lifts her gaze, and provided she maintains the cost each
Pulse. She cannot maintain the effect on multiple targets since she
can only gaze at one thing at a time but she can lift it at any time
without using any kind of Action at all.

Her gaze is Avoided if the target Breaks 100 and adds AG to the
result, or WP if the effect is to be Opposed.  This halves the Stat
involved or reduces it by ten, whichever is the least, and lasts until
the end of the next Pulse.  This magic draws one from a special
reserve in her 'heart'.  This starts at five, and may be raised by one
at the end of an Adventure or Season, whichever is least, at a cost of
two thousand five hundred Experience. It recovers as if it were normal
FT, but only after all normal FT has been restored.


# Ravenna

## Coruscade - Stained Glass Plate

Range
: Self

Duration
: 30 minutes + 30 / Rank

Base Chance
: 10%

Resist
: None

Target
: Sentient Entity

Effects
: Planes of Stained Glass appear around the Adept in the form of plate
armour. Their Defence is increased by 2% (+ 3 per two full Ranks), and
if they are struck by a weapon that is not magical or silvered, 1
point per three full Ranks is subtracted from the damage.  This
applies to blows directly to EN or Specific Grievous inujuries, but
not the special damage of that injury. However, a Specific Grievous
injury will cause the armour to shatter, ending the incantation but
anyone adjacent to them must Resist vs Backfire or lose their next
Strike Action, as the armour splinters into a kaleidoscopic explosion
of colours.

Cost
: 750 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell.

## Slowness - Inertial Field

Range
: Self

Duration
: 30 minutes +  30 / Rank, or while distortions last

Base Chance
: 20%

Resist
: None

Target
: Sentient Entity

Effects
: One transparent, vaguely sperhical distortion in the air (+ 1 per
three Ranks) orbit the Adept for the duration of the spell. Whenever
the Adept would be struck by a FT blow by a physical wweapon in Melee
or at Range, then the damage is halved as the distortion absorbs part
of the impact.  This dooes not apply to blows directly to EN or
Specific Grievous injuries.

Cost
: 750 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell.

## Chasm Toad

Natural Habitat
: Abysmal pits, the Void

Frequency
:  Rare

Number
:  1 (256)

Description
: Chasm toads are found near the border of the Abyss and the Void.
They are said to be the consequence of a night hag mating with an
abysmal demon who fell into a chaos reactor at the onset of labour.
They stand somewhere between thirty and forty five centimetres tall,
and weigh between fourteen ounces and four pounds. They have dark
green, leathery skin covered in lighter coloured warts.

There is a theory that from time to time, an adult toad will “seethe”
and excrete a greenish slime. Some time later, they divide into a
swarm of chasm toadlets which is always an exponent of two in number.

Abilities
:  Chasm toads are enchanted creatures whose intelligence grows to be
near that of the entities it associates with. They are capable of
storing as much as one cubic foot of material by swallowing it, but
the maximum dimension is no more than half of its height. Dimensions
less that one foot are considered to be one foot for the purposes of
calculating storage capacity.

As they advance, some of these toads are able to manifest small
patches which are similar to the Deep Pockets spell, except that empty
ones may be thrown by the toad to capture something that will fit
inside, or that will inflict 1 D10! (+ 1 per Rank) on contact if it is
too big to fit. Targets are entitled to a Magic Resistance check
versus Dark Celestial Special Knowledge magic, taking half damage if
they succeed.

Movement Rates
: Hopping: 250, Climbing 150

-------  -------  -------  -------  --------  -------


Weapons
: Bite BC 50% [D10! + 2], 3 hexes, RMC, Maximum Rank 6, advances as a
Lasso.

Note
: The toad can target something that is less than a quarter of its
mass with its tongue and draw it in to deliver a bite

Storage
: If the toad is fed something that it can digest, it will consume it.
This can include friends. If the toad is fed a poison, it will absorb
it and may deliver it with a bite. A record of toxins should be
kept. Anything stored in the toad (except poison) will experience one
tenth of the normal rate of time. It will be as if only one day was
experienced over the passage of ten.

## Hoardling

Hoardling is a chasm toad. He stands thirty centimetres tall, and
weighs fourteen ounces, but has hopes of acquiring greater mass. He
identifies as a toad and his pronouns are he, him, and occasionally
they/them. The maximum Rank he can know any language is six, which is
his current Rank in Thari.

He is convinced that on the occasion of his warts turning yellow, he
will experience a great “change” and advance to the next level of his
progression.

He would like to become a monk. Or a fireman.

Note
: Hoardling can target something that is less than three ounces with
his tongue and draw it in to deliver a bite

Storage
: If Hoardling is fed something that he can digest, he will consume
it.  This can include friends. If he is fed a poison, he will absorb
it and may deliver it with a bite. A record of such toxins should be
kept. Anything stored (except poison) will experience one tenth of the
normal rate of time. It will be as if only one day was experienced
over the passage of ten.


# Mount Olympus in Cyprus

## Benediction of Land and Beast (R-B)

Range
: Sight

Duration
: 3 months for every Rank that is prime

Experience Multiple
: 125

Base Chance
: 45%

Resist
: None

Cast Time
: 1 hour

Target
: Area, Livestock, Entity

Effects
: The ritual increases the richness of the soil of 1 acre (+ 1 acre /
Rank).  For the duration of the magic everything grown in that soil
will be proof against locusts, droughts, flooding, frost, and other
natural disasters.

If the ritual is cast upon a pregnant entity, it will increase the
unborn child's EN value by one, raising it by three at Rank 10 and
finally raising it by six at Rank 20.

It can also be cast upon 5 (+ 1 / Rank) livestock that are within
sight. These animals will then be resistant to natural disorders, such
as rabies, dysentery, worms, and hoof and mouth disease for the
duration.

Finally, it can be cast to dissipate the effects of a Spell of
Blighting Crops or Spell of Pestilence.

## Weapon of Mettle (S-5)

Range
: 5 feet + 5 / Rank

Duration
: 5 minutes + 1 / Rank

Experience Multiple
: 250

Base Chance
: 30%

Resist
: None

Storage
: Investment

Target
: Object

Effects
: This spell is cast over a weapon of the Adept’s choice, increasing
its strike chance by Rank% (minimum of 1). If it is cast upon a weapon
that inflicts A Class damage, then it increases the Penetration of the
weapon by 1 for every two full Ranks.  Penetration does not increase
damage, instead, it reduces the target's Protection. If cast upon a
swinging weapon (hafted B or C Class weapons and military pick), it
strengthens the weapon so that bonuses for excess PS can be applied
without possibility of weapon breakage, unless PS exceeds 40.  If it
is cast upon a weapon that inflicts C Class damage, then it inflict 1
extra point of damage for every three or fraction Ranks.  At Rank 20,
an extra D10 C Class damage is added.  Beyond the enhancement to
Strike Chance, none of these bonuses apply to B Class swords.

## Farsensing (T-F)

Range
: 15 feet + 15 / Rank

Duration
: Active concentration

Experience Multiple
: 150

Target
: Controlled Animal

Effects
: The Adept can, by remaining stationary and actively concentrating
for the duration of the talent’s workings, see, hear, taste, smell and
feel the same things as their familiar, provided that their familiar
is within 15 feet (+ 15 feet / Rank) of their position.  This talent
allows no special communication with the familiar, merely the ability
to utilise their senses. The Adept must have already taken control of
the animalfor this talent to be effective.  It takes about 2 Pulses
(−1 / 5 full Ranks) for the Adept to tune in to the familiar’s senses.
If the familiar is killed while the Adept is using this talent, they
suffer magical backlash D10 + 10 damage due to shock. This damage can
Stun.

Experience Multiple

Base Chance
: 30%

Resist
: None

Storage
: Potion, Ward

Target
: Self

Effects
: The Adept may transform themselves into a Hart or Hind, depending on
gender, which is not fully manifest in the real world.  While in this
spectral form, they have, instead, a combined FT and EN value of 20 (+
5 per 3 Ranks, 60 at Rank 20).  Once this value is exhausted, duration
expires or they take a Pass Action to end the spell, they resume their
original form.  Damage inflicted to the spectral form does not roll
over to their personal FT and/or EN unless this would be sufficient to
kill them outright (i.e. combined FT & EN of the spectral form +
remaining FT + (1.5 × remaining EN)).

If they are under the effects of a Walking Unseen spell, then they may
not be clearly identified or directly magically targeted by sight
unless the Rank of Enhanced Vision, Witchsight or similar magic is
equal or higher.

While in this form, they can run overland at their TMR (+1 per 5
Ranks) and, over the course of a minute, enter a spectral trail where
their movement rate is 30 miles per hour (+1 mile per hour per Rank).

## Ride the Wind (T-RW)

: Corniger may Ride the Wind at his TMR (+ or − 1 for every four full
Ranks).  If he does not maintain his TMR, he falls.  At heights
greater than thirteen metres above the ground, he may call a wind that
will increase his movement rate to twenty miles per hour (+1 mile per
hour per Rank). His rate of climb is one hex up for every two
horizontal.

# Rome and surroundings

## Dominican Chainmail

This mail shirt covers a humanoid of size 6 from the shoulders to the
knees, and must be belted.  It weighs 42 lbs, reduces AG by 2, Stealth
by 15 and improves Magic Resistance by 15.  It provides Protection of
10, EN Armour of 1 and 3 points of Spell Armour.  However, the wearer
adds 15 to the result of any Cast Check, and any roll of "00" is
always a backfire, regardless of Cast Chance.

Once a day, and at a cost of 10 FT, the wearer may double their base
PS for three consecutive Pulses. Magical enhancements to PS stack but
are not doubled.


## Tabard of the Hounds of God

This white linen tabard has a black hound, rampant, breathing flames,
embroidered into it with thread spun from the sinews of a night gaunt.
It will fit any human, elf or orc, weighs four pounds and may be worn
over chain or plate armour.  Wearing this tabard penalises FT recovery
by one.  For example, if the wearer would normally recover three FT
from tea, then they recover two.  If the wearer avoids this cost on
three consecutive occasions, the embroidery rots and the magic is
lost.

The wearer takes one less damage from magic that drains life, and
their Defence is improved by seven.  In addition, they may increase
their half move TMR by one.  For example, if their TMR is five, then
their half move TMR would normally be three, but wearing the tabard
would make it four.

# Vatican Crypt

##  Gossamer of Stolen Dreams

This silken chiffon, spun from the nervous system of a thought eater
and the tendons of thirteen nightgaunts is teal green and can be made
into a diaphonouus shoulder cape or shawl. It weighs eleven ounces and
has no special properties if it is worn over plate, chain, scale mail
or any kind of metalic armour. And it would look odd in a bad way.

If it is worn over soft leather armour or similar, it extends somewhat
into the Astral, and so will provide five more points of Protection
(to a maximum of thirteen), eight points of Spell Armour, and one
point of Damage Reduction, which applies to everything except the
special damage of Specific Grievous injuries and poisons.

In addition, the wearer can feel through the the shawl, so it provides
one point of Defence for every three points of Agility. However,
although it protects against damage, it is entirely transparent to
pain. If they receive a blow that inflicts ten points of damage, then
they will take five fewer points because of the shawl, but they may be
Stunned if the full amount is greater than one third of their modified
EN value.

For the purposes of determining how long it will take to repair, the
shawl has ten EN which it recovers at a rate of one point every three
days. If an attempt is made to heal it, this will destroy the
nightgaunt tendons, freeing the thought eater, which will be very
hungry.

It will require the arts of a Rank 4 Seamstress or Tailor to make the
shawl, and they will charge 50 truesilver guineas for their work.

## The Two-Faced Blade

This broadsword has a long, slightly curved blade, etched on either side with glyphs:

מעמקי קברים ונוגה נר
and
אני חורט מסכת מוות מר

It is made from infernal gravesteel, is always darker than the
surrounding light level and it weighs nine pounds.

At the centre of the quillons, a funeral mask is carved onto a bronze
disk, its expression varying on examination from despair to glee. The
pommel stone is a cairngorm the size of a hen's egg, which glows
sombrely.

A PS of 27 and MD of 15 is required to wield this weapon. The base
Strike Chance is 67% and it inflicts 2 D10! + 11 B Class damage. Twos
rolled on the damage dice are read as sevens. The only weapon spell it
accepts is Spectral Weapon and it does not provide bonuses for damage
because of excess PS. It does provide damage bonuses for every four
Ranks in Broadsword, only.

If the inscriptions are deciphered, then more of its functions may be
revealed.


## Sard Vial of Healing

This vial is made of banded sardonyx and is the length and thickness
of a blacksmith's thumb. It weighs fourteen ounces at the moment and
seven ounces when empty..

The vial has five more charges.

Currently, the contents of the vial will cure seven points of damage
in the following order of precedence: Specific Grievous injuries >> EN
damage >> FT damage. The entire dose must be taken for it to take
effect, any excess healing is lost.

To empower the vial, an Alchemist must draw their own blood,
concentrate it, titrate it and decant it therein. The first point of
healing costs 1 EN, the next costs 2 EN, the third costing 3 EN, and
so on. This EN loss may only be recovered by natural healing. The
weight (less 7 ounces) indicates how many points it heals.

## Alchemical Formula

A Phylactery of Flesh and Bone, Bound in Shadow and Thought (Alchemy Rank 9)

Materials Required:
- Bone of the Forsaken – Ivory from a beast that has never known a grave
- Fibres of the Starved Mind – Thought Eater spinal filaments,
  preserved in void-salt and spun together with the tendons of night
  gaunts
- Ectoplasm of the Lost 
- Blood of the Maker – One drop, freely given
- Ash of a Broken Hourglass 
- Wax of the Nameless Candle – Taken from a shrine where no god is worshipped 

The Process of Creation:

Crafting the Skeletal Vessel
: Shape ivory into a hollow reliquary in the shape of a
skeleton. Engrave glyphs on the bone that preserve against rot and
deny rest. The ivory must be soaked in grave-essence, the leavings of
a corpse exhumed before it was forgotten.

Spinning the Fibres of the Starved Mind
: Weave the Fibres of the Starved Mind into a lattice within the
reliquary, threading them through channels of bone like creeping
veins. Let them drink from an infusion of whispered ink, made of
ravens' tongues and monk-sealed secrets, to grant the vessel stolen
voices.

Crafting Fateless Life
: Lay the Ash of a Broken Hourglass in a vessel of amber and set in
inside the skull, ensuring the vessel is anchored in time yet outside
of fate.

Binding the Spirit’s Flesh
: Slowly fold Ectoplasm of the Lost into the frame, letting it take the
shape of withered flesh. The specters within will scream but will not
escape. Let it harden under thirteen full moons, one of which must be
blue.

Sealing with Blood and Breath
: Drip a single drop of your own blood into the phylactery’s heart,
binding its will to your own. Speak this phrase: "Ut mortem fallam, ut
vita taceat."

The phylactery will awaken, hollow-eyed and knowing. It will move,
breathe, and whisper, but it will not live.

## Sienna

Natural Habitat 
: Arctic, Plains, Rural, Waste, Woods 

Frequency 
: Unique

Number 
: 1-2 (1) 

Description 
: Sienna is a Midsummer Fox about ten inches high at the shoulder, and
  is Summer/Fire aspected. She weighs six pounds, and can vary the
  colour of her fur black with fine silver traces that are only
  visible under moonlight, to brown, orange or brownish red to
  white. She gains +10 to Stealth, and a further +10 if in a natural
  environment that supports her colouration.  She has an acute sense
  of smell.

Comments 
: Sienna was born of a fox of Lyonesse and a vixen of Nualis. Her
  plane of origin is always the same as the person she bonds to.

Abilities 
: Sienna may Cast Petit Mort upon herself at Rank 11, and this counts
  as Racial Magic.  While under the influence of this magic, she is
  dimly aware of her environment.

She can Cast the Firelight spell by touching her target with her
brush, and this will manifest as blue-green flames.  In addition to
their normal effects, this fire will set fire to illusory objects
which are supposed to be capable of burning.

Movement Rates 
: Running: 300

----- ----  ------ ---  -----  ---  ---- ----   -----   ----------------
PS: 	5 	MD: 	19 	AG: 	24 	MA: 	8 	EN: 7 	FT: 12 

WP: 	18 	PC: 	12 	PB: 	14 	TMR: 	6 	NA: 	Fur absorbs 1 DP 
----- ----  ------ ---  -----  ---  ---- ----   ----    ----------------


Weapons 
: Bite: BC 50%, [D - 2], Close, A Class damage, Rank 9, advances as a
  dagger but can only deliver Specific Grievous injuries to creatures
  that weigh less than three pounds.

Brush
: Sienna can Cast the Pyrotechnics spell from her brush which will
  have the usual effects except that any entities in the volume of
  effect will be dazzled until they take 1 Pass Action (+ l per 3
  Ranks) to clear their vision. If they succeed, they need only take 1
  Pass Action. She can move half her TMR while Preparing this spell
  and half before, during or after Casting. This counts as Racial
  magic but Special Knowledge Counterspells of the College of Fire
  Magic apply to Resistance (only) and cannot prevent Casting.

## Ritual of Binding a Midsummer Vixen

Range
: Touch

Duration
: Immediate

Experience Multiple
: 250

Target
: Entity

Cast Time
: 1 hour

Material
: 101 flies or similar

Concentration Check
: Standard

Effects
: The Adept may attempt to bind a midsummer vixen that will serve them
  as a familiar. If the binding is successful, the Adept promises to
  feed and protect the vixen.

The Ritual confers no particular ability to communicate with
it. however, these vixens are noted for their ability to swiftly pick
up the language of those they associate with. If the Adept has a means
of speaking with foxes, then they can instruct the vixen while if
they’re within range.

If the Adept fails to feed and look after it on a regular basis, or
mistreats it in any way, it may run away. Otherwise, it will serve the
Adept to the best of its ability, warning them of danger, and so
forth. If it is killed, the Adept suffers [D + 5] points of damage in
the form of a magical backlash. This damage may not be resisted.

As the ritual is Ranked, the Adept and vixen gain abilities according
to the following schedule:


-----   ------------------------------------------------------------
Rank	Effects

0       The Adept acquires the vixen’s ability to sprint to safety, and so gains a Dash pool. For every Rank, including this, the Adept adds one to this pool. They may add 1/3rd of their pool, minimum 1, to their full TMR in a Pulse as a Free Act. The pool is fully restored at dusk.

1       While it is bound to the Adept, the vixen is a legal target for the Raise Dead ability of a practitioner of the Healing art
2	    The Adept may cast spells that target themselves on the vixen

3       When worn as a fur, the vixen will improve the Adept’s effective PB by 1 for every three Ranks. This is a function of fashion and  style, not an actual change to their appearance, and is limited to their racial maximum

4       The Adept may share the vixen's senses once a day. At this Rank, they may see through their eyes

5       Uncanny Dodge - The Adept gains the ability to avoid a physical blow by Breaking 100 + the unmodified damage of the attack, adding the vixen’s AG + their own to the result. This is a Reflex Action but cannot be used when surprised. This ability resets at dusk.

6       The Adept may draw upon the FT of the vixen to pay the FT cost of a spell or ritual. In addition, they can restore the vixen's FT at a rate of 2:1

7       The Adept sense of smell increases which improves their ability to forage, identify and find plants and animals, track, locate and identify herbs. The Adept adds the vixen’s PC to these Base Chances.

8       The Adept adds the vixen’s PC to the Detect Trap ability, if the Adept has the Thief Skill, and Detect Hidden if they have the Ranger Skill.

9       The Adept shares the vixen's senses twice a day. At this Rank, they may see and hear what the vixen sees and hears

10      The vixen can hold 1 spell matrix. This will not unrack unless the spell or incantation specifies that it will. The Adept must be in contact with the vixen to use the matrix

11      While the vixen is worn as a fur, the Adept acquires a sense for danger, by Breaking 100 + PC + Rank of this ritual, causing the hair on the back of their neck to rise. No further information is provided

12      The Adept may draw from their Dash pool to add up to 1/3rd to their half TMR movement in a Pulse as a Free Act

13      The Adept gains a second Uncanny Dodge

14      The Adept may share the vixen's senses three times a day, being able to smell as well as see and hear

15      The Adept may draw from their Dash pool and use up to 1/3rd of it to move and attack without attracting a penalty to Strike Chance

16      The Adept may, if they Break 100 and add the vixen’s PC to the result, find the nearest exit from an enclosed space

17      While the vixen is worn as a fur, the Adept’s social status is increased  by one

18      The Adept may draw from their Dash pool and use up to 1/3rd of it to move while executing a Defensive Withdrawal

19      The Adept gains a third Uncanny Dodge

20      The spell matrix becomes a spell lock, which the vixen can Cast on the Adept's behalf. This will not unrack unless specified by the spell or incantation

## The Discord Serpent (Zmey Gorynych)

This is the Individual True Name of a unique entity, Zmey
Gorynych. There are only 21 Ranks available. In other words, every
Rank this Name is raised reduces someone else's Rank by the same
amount amount.

If the Spell of Name Change is known, and their Rank in the Generic
True Name 'Snake' is Ranked to 10 or higher, then they may assume a
dracoform with green and black scales whose properties are described
below. They may also assume the form of a green and black serpent as
long in feet as their Rank in the spell. The serpent will weigh
(length + (length × length))/2 in lbs.

It can fit through a gap which is no narrower than 1 inch (+1 inch for
every three feet of length).

Adept's WP   Adept's    10    3 + length/4   3

Weapons
: The serpent can bite in Close or Melee Combat

BC
: 61%,1 roll-up D10 + (length/3), A Class damage

The Bite is Ranked as a Short Sword

The damage the bite inflicts depends on the length of the serpent. If
the serpent is less than ten feet long, the damage dice only reflects
how much armour is defeated. If this is insufficient to penetrate
armour, then no venom is delivered. If the length is 10 feet or
greater, then the bite inflicts standard A class damage.

Venom from the bite is equal to 1 for every four Ranks in the Generic
True Name and each application lasts for D10 Pulses.

Every 4 Ranks in this Generic True Name 'Snake' increases PS, AG, EN
and PB by 1

The shade of the scales may be subtly altered to improve Stealth by
the Rank of the Generic True Name while in a natural terrain that is
not arctic.

The serpent has Racial Magic that lets it:

- see heat sources as faint as a mammal up to 25 feet distant even in
  complete darkness allows it to hold its breath for a number of
  minutes equal to its EN.
- meet the gaze of an entity that is half its weight or less and
  immobilise, unless the victim takes a Pass Action
- The serpent has a land TMR of 3 (+length/3), a swimming TMR of 4, a
  climbing TMR of 2, and a land movement rate of 50 yards per minute
  per five feet of length.

A battleform may also be assumed where the Adept assumes the shape of
a humanoid drake whose body is as long as their humanoid height and a
muscular tail half as long again. Their armour merges with their green
and black scales, but their other equipment is disposed around their
body as usual. When the Individual True Name is Rank 10 or higher,
membranous wings appear on the battleform's back and allow a limited
form of flight.

Changing between the serpent shape and the battleform requires a Pass Action. 

It provides 1 point of Damage Reduction (+1 for every 10 Ranks in the
Individual True Name) against all known forms of damage.

Every 4 Ranks in this Individual True Name increases PS, MD, AG, EN
and NA by 1.

Every 4 Ranks in this Generic True Name 'Snake' increases PS, AG, EN
and PB by 1.

The battleform has three heads, although only one can be manifested at
a time, and changing heads requires a Pass Action. At Rank 20 in the
Individual True Name, changing heads requires a Free Act.

Agon is not very smart but can breathe fire in a cone that is Rank of
the Individual True Name long in hexes and half that at the base.  It
inflicts 1 rollup D10 + Rank in the Individual True Name to everything
in the volume. Magic Resistance is not usually allowed against this
unless the victim is on the edge of the volume. Once used, Agon's
breath weapon recovers when a six on a die is rolled.

Spokononyy is not very brave but can transfix a victim by gazing
unless they succeed in a Break 100 roll adding 2 × their WP to the
result. If they fail, they may only take Pass Actions to remove the
transfixation. For every five Ranks in the Individual True Name, the
victim must make an extra Pass Action. Once used, Spokononyy's gaze
weapon recovers when an eight on a die is rolled.

Kusat is not very polite but has a bite that inflicts twice as much
damage as the other heads and can attack a target up to 10 feet
distant.

The Adept's player may check each Pulse to determine if a head's
weapon has recovered.

If the Discord Serpent is decapitated, then they have two chances in
three of manifesting another head, and if decapitated again, then one
chance in three.

Weapons
: Heads can bite in Close or Melee Combat

- Bite    BC: 71%, 1 roll-up D10 (+Individual True Name / 4), B Class damage, MC, Ranks as a  claymore
- Claw    BC: 57%, 1 roll-up D10 + 1 (+ Individual True Name/10), A Class damage, MC, Ranks as a dagger
- Tail    BC: 47%, 2 roll-up D10 (+Individual True Name / 4), C Class damage, M, Ranks as a whip. 

The Adept can deliver a claw/claw/bite routine or if other weapons are
used, only a bite can be delivered.

The tail can make one attack into a rear hex of the Adept but does not
count against their others since it is a Reflex Action.

The wings have the following flight properties

- flying requires a clear space around the Adept of about a megahex.
- the Adept must spend 1 FT at the beginning of every Pulse that they
  intend to fly.
- the Adept must maintain an airspeed equivalent to TMR 7 (-1 for
  every three Ranks in the individual True Name) to avoid stalling and
  beginning to fall.
- maximum rate of climb is an angle of 45°, and each Pulse climbing
  like this costs an additional point of FT. Climbing at a rate of 1
  hex per 2 horizontal hexes does not cost additional FT.

In addition, wings may be used to batter opponents up to 10 feet
distant or Melee Combat

BC
: 53%, 1 roll-up D10 + 2 (+ Individual True Name / 10), C Class
damage. ME, Ranks as a quarterstaff. Two wing attacks may be made
without penalty unless the Adept is using other weapons, in which case
only one wing attack is allowed.

# Mindflayers

## Voidsilk Robe × 2

This robe is made from voidsilk, and is the colour of migraines. It
will conform in fit to anyone of size 6 or less.  The wearer must
sacrifice a point of EN to bind the robes to them.  Once bound, it has
the following properties:

- +1 WP
- 6 points of Protection and 8 points of Spell Armour which will stack
  with Natural Armour or that made from plant or animal fibres but not
  leather, wooden, ceramic or metal armour.

  Necrosis, Torment, venom or similar.
- If the wearer is the target of a Defence spell, it increases that
  Defence by another 7

  becomes 1 per four Ranks not 1 per five and 1 extra Magic Resistance
  for every four Ranks.
- The wearer may buy a point of spell casting FT for the robe at a
  cost of 1,999 Experience, which may be used (only) for the casting
  of spells or rituals. The maximum FT that can be stored is 10, and
  only one such point may be bought per season or adventure, whichever
  is least.

## Mindflayer Belt × 2

This belt weighs 5 lbs and is made from five 5 inch by 2 inch sections
of a pale blue cairngorms, joined by dark green opaque links, made of
jade.  It may be draped over a shoulder by threading through a sturdy
epaulette, or worn around the neck like a stole and strapped into
position on armour, but must be securely attached.  It is as tough as
steel and as flexible as willow.

If the wearer spends 1 FT, this belt reduces their weight down to
1/3rd, 90 lbs becomes 30 lbs, etc, and Encumbrance will have to be
recalculated.  This effect lasts for 10 minutes, and can be renewed as
long as the wearer pays the FT cost.

## Storage Crystal × 2

This crystal is transparent and a pale yellow in colour.  It is a
regular duodecimal solid that is 12 cms across and weighs 1 lb.  It
can be used to store power or spell casting FT at a rate of 1 point
per 10 minutes of focused concentration during which no other activity
can be undertaken.

The crystal, currently, has a value of 0, being empty. To increase its
storage capacity to 1, the user must spend as many days as the next
prime value and the same value in thousands of Experience.  Thus, the
user must spend two days two thousand Experience to raise it from 0
to 1.  To increase capacity from 1 to 2, they must spend (3-2=1) one
day and one thousand Experience.

The storage capacity of the crystal cannot be raised beyond 10, and
the user spends 2 of their FT to store 1 in the crystal, which takes 1
hour. These need not be consecutive.

These points can only be used for paying the FT cost of Spells or Rituals. 

## Crystal Wand of Linking Sense

This crystal wand is 31 cms long, tapering to a five faced point at
the tip, and weighs eleven ounces.  Charges: 1

The wielder adds their MA Bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance. If
their WP is greater than the target, they further increase the Cast
Chance by the difference. If it is lower, then the Cast Chance is
penalised by twice the difference.

Cast Chance
: 38%

Range
: 105 feet

Duration
: Conc. Max. 70 minutes

Resistance
: Active & Passive

Target
: Living entity

Effects
: The Adept may Trigger this effect by pointing the wand at a target
  within range that they can see and requires but a Fire Action. If
  the target fails to Resist, the Adept may see through the target's
  eyes until the spell ends.

While it is in effect, they may not apply their Agility to their
Defence, nor may they see through their own eyes.

## Crystal Wand of Mental Restoration

This crystal wand is 31 cms long, tapering to a three faced point at
the tip, and weighs eleven ounces.

Charges
: 8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1

The wielder adds their MA Bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance. If
their WP is greater than the target, they further increase the Cast
Chance by the difference. If it is lower, then the Cast Chance is
penalised by twice the difference.

Cast Chance
: 38%

Range
: Touch

Duration
: Immediate, during Pulse

Resistance
: None

Target
: Entity

Effects
: The Adept may Trigger this effect by touching their patient with the
  wand and requires but a Fire Action. The Adept may restore a mental
  stat (MA, WP, PC or FT) by one for every prime value of FT spent,
  thus:

FT spent    Amount restored
--------    ------------------------
    2                1
    3                2
    5                3
    7                4
   11                5
   13                6
   17                7 

and so on. 

## Stone of Resilience

This dull, faceted stone is grey and opaque, and weighs one lb. 

Charges
: 3    2    1

The stone must be carried on the Adept's body, and if it is not then
the magic ends.

It takes three Pass Actions to trigger the stone, after which the
fibres of the Adept's body knit together more elastically for ten
minutes.  While the effect is in place, the Adept Reduces Damage that
crushes by 2.

## Dream Antivenin Amulet

This small, engraved amulet of white jade must be worn over the heart
and next to the skin, so will not be obvious unless the wearer wishes
it. When it is obvious, the wearer's PB increases by 1 to their racial
maximum and reduces the die roll result of any Courtier/Courtesan
Skill Check by 7.

It holds three charges
: 3    2    1

If the wearer is subjected to a mental venom, then a charge is drawn
off and they are given a second chance to avoid the effects. If there
is no chance to avoid the venom, then a charge is drawn off to provide
one.

As the charges are used, the amulet changes to colour from white, to
pale green, to dark green and finally to blue.

## Willhammer

This weapon is a cumulative warhammer and military pick, each of which
has a maximum Rank of 5.  It is a one handed weapon, weighs four
pounds, requires PS 15 and MD 13 to wield.  It has a base Strike
Chance of 67%, may be wielded at Range or in Melee, inflicts D10 + 7 A
or C Class damage and has a range of six hexes.  This means that a
roll in the range of either an A or C Class Specific Grievous injury
is legal, but FT damage is assumed to be A Class unless C Class damage
is specified by the wielder.  The maximum bonus from PS is +4.

If the result on the damage die is a prime, then the cumulative Ranks
of this weapon are divided by 4 and the result truncated, their WP
divided by 5 and the result truncated then both are added to the prime
as damage. If it would inflict EN damage, it is, instead, applied to
WP.  This is in addition to the other damage this weapon inflicts.

## Arc Rod

This weapon is a gnarled rod of bark-covered blackthorn about a metre
long. It weighs 11 lbs, even though, by appearance, it would only
weigh 2. Nevertheless, it will still float in water.

It may be wielded as a mace, requiring PS 23 + MD 18 to wield, and has
a base Strike chance of 61%. At a cost of 3 lbs of weight, it will
inflict charged particle damage to a ranged or melee opponent. Targets
take damage depending on their armour, 4D10 if caparisoned in metal,
2D10 otherwise, but bonuses from PS are not applied. If any damage die
generates a 10, then the wielder makes a Strike Check against a target
within 5 feet, preferring those caparisoned in metal (excluding the
wielder), who also take damage accordingly. This process continues
until no tens are generated. No target may receive this attack more
than once per strike.

The rod will recover 3 lbs of weight if it is Purified with and
presented to the sky at dawn on a Thursday.

## Ghost Shield

This large round shield weighs 6 lbs, provides 5 Def per Rank to a
maximum of 25 and penalises MD by 2. For every Rank in excess of 4, it
redirects effects that drain life into a Thirst Pool. The maximum
capacity of the Thirst Pool is 20, and if this is exceeded, all of it
is applied to the wielder, catastrophically.

## Brain Serum × 2

This brass ball is four centimetres across with a screw on cap, and
weighs four ounces. It contains a grey, soupy liquid which, when
taken, cures any injury to the mind or brain, except those that
require complete regeneration taking five minutes.

## Eye Serum

This brass ball is four centimetres across with a screw on cap, and
weighs four ounces. It contains a greenish, soupy liquid which, when
poured into the eye sockets of a single entity, cure blindness from
any cause except those that require complete regeneration taking five
minutes.

## Revification Injection

This hypodermic syrinx is made from surgical brass. It weighs fifteen
oz, the ampoule being twelve cms long by three cms across, with the
syrinx an extra ten cms long. The aperture of the syrinx is five mm
across and is in the shape of a cuboid cylinder with rounded
vertices. Instead of a plunger, a brass gear and crank mechanism is
attached. Some people believe they hear woeful moaning coming from it.

The action of delivery is to drive the syrinx into the breast of the
dead entity, and then to turn the handle, crushing the contents and
forcing them into the target's heart, which will bring them back to
life. The injection must be administered within 24 hours after death
or it does not function at all. Further, for each hour that elapses
after death(minimum one), the patient suffers 1 point of drain from
each Primary Characteristic and Fatigue. This loss can only be
restored by Natural Recovery (one point every three days of rest).

Further, the injection does not heal wounds, neutralize poisons, or
cure diseases, so if proper healing is not administered immediately
(or beforehand), the patient may simply die upon being revivified.

The subject need not be willing and does not normally get any
opportunity to Resist.

## Verminbane Grenado

This grenado weighs 2 lbs, and is made of shards of glass held at the
very moment of fracture.  When it is smashed, three shifting,
discordant tones emanate from it, inflicting 2 rollup D5 non-magical
sonic damage directly to EN over a hemisphere 30 feet across (200
cu. metres or 7,000 cu. ft.).  Prot is not applied, although Damage
Reduction vs Sonics applies.  For every 3 damage taken, a victim
attracts a "disorientation point", requiring a Pass Action to remove,
and no other Action can be taken until they are all gone.

In an enclosed space, the damage increases to 4 rollup D5.

## Antivenin Slime

This test tube weighs 5 oz, and is sealed with a plug of infused
beeswax. It contains a slime that, when swallowed, will spread
throughout the subject's system and remove any synthetic poison that
is less than Rank 5. If the synthetic poison Rank is higher than 4,
then the subject Breaks 100 + EN and if that result is higher than
100 + Rank, then they have successfully thrown the slime, and the
poison, up. While this will take at least thirty seconds, if
successful, no further damage is done.

# Void Cruiser

This crystal wand is 31 cms long, tapering to a five faced point at
the tip, and weighs eleven ounces.

Charges
: 6    5    4    3    2    1

The wielder adds their MA Bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance. If

penalised by twice the difference.

Cast Chance
: 38%

Range
: 105 feet

Duration
: Conc. Max. 70 minutes

Resistance
: Active & Passive

Target
: Living entity

Effects
: The Adept may Trigger this effect by pointing the wand at a target

until the spell ends.  While it is in effect, they may not apply their
Agility to their Defence, nor may they see through their own eyes.

## Crystal Wand of Mental Fingers

This crystal wand is 31 cms long, tapering to a four faced point at
the tip, and weighs eleven ounces.  Charges:

7    6    5    4    3    2    1

The wielder adds their MA Bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance. If
their WP is greater than the target, they further increase the Cast

Effects
: The Adept may Trigger this effect by pointing the wand at a lock or

## Ear Serum × 2

This brass ball is four centimetres across with a screw on cap, and
weighs four ounces. It contains a bluish, soupy liquid which, when
poured into the ear of a single entity, cures deafness from any cause
except those that require complete regeneration, and only taking five
minutes.

## Eyestalk Harness

This cuir-bouilli gorget is studded with bronze rivets and weighs 1 lb
and 9 oz. It increases the wearer's Defence by 3, and in the event
that Specific Grievous Injury result is 68 or 69, then 2 is added to
the D10 result to determine the location of the wound. A result of 11
or 12 indicates that the Specific Grievous Injury has missed
completely and no damage is inflicted.

At a cost of 1 FT, the wearer may extend one or more of their eyes (to
a maximum of 5) on stalks that extend as far as 50 cms for twelve
Pulses.  In the event that the wearer receives a Specific Grievous
Injury that results in an amputation, then an eye is lost.

## Animated Exoskeleton

This device is eighteen inches tall, made from curved tiles of dark
green laen connected by rods of orichalcum, and will fit a
brownie. The wearer must sacrifice 1 EN to bind the exoskeleton to
themselves, whereupon it will raise the wearer's

* PS to the next prime
* AG to the next prime
* non-flight TMR to the next prime
* Defence to the next prime
* NA to the next prime

It will also convert the wearer's Natural Armour to Damage
Reduction. This will not apply to poison, disease, Disruption,
Necrosis, Putrid Wound or similar effects

# Witch

## Rod of the Void

This slender rod weighs 2 lbs, and may be wielded as a mace. It
requires PS 12, MD 9 and has a base Strike Chance of 61%. It inflicts
2 rollup D10 and may be thrown ten hexes. When not wielded as a
weapon, it has the appearance of a decorative cane and its weapon
characteristics will not be revealed by Detect Aura.

- It inflicts one point of damage over five seconds to anyone holding
  it as a consequence of contact with the Void. Creatures that are
  older than the universe do not take this damage.

- The Void is considered to be dimensionally proximate to the entity
  wielding it.

- It incrases the wielder's PB by 1 to racial maximum, but if they
  have the distinctive appearance feature, it increases this by
  fifteen.

- Rank in Courtier is improved by one.

## Baba Yaga's Pestle

This heavy mace weighs 7 lbs, requires PS 22, MD 9 and has a base
Strike Chance of 53%. It inflicts one rollup D10 + 5 C Class damage in
melee.

When it is thrown, the mass increases for every hex it passes
through. Thus, for each hex it travels to its target, the damage
increases by one rollup D10 to a maximum of 5 rollup D10. Four more
damage may be added for every 5 PS greater than 22,but bonuses from
Warrior or Assassin do not apply.

Once the Pestle has completed its movement, it returns to the wielder
in an unreadied state. The wielder rolls a D10 at the end of each
Pulse, a 9 or 0 meaning it has become readied.

## Baba Yaga's Mortar

This marble mortar is seven inches in diameter and weighs 55 oz. Once
a day, resetting at noon, and requiring the uttering of a Word of
Power is uttered (Pass Action), it will grow to be five feet in
diameter but with no appreciable increase in weight.
 
It is a legal target for the Instilling Flight spell, improving the
Base Chance by 10, and changing the duration to 30 minutes (+30
minutes per Rank). So long as they maintain at least one hex of
movement per Pulse, they may choose to move at their Tactical Movement
Rate.

Defence versus ranged or melee attacks from below is increased by 20,
and Protection against these attacks is increased by 10.

## Critical Key

This bronze key is chased in silver and weighs 4 oz. It is a magical
lock pick which, if the wielder rolls fifteen per cent or less of
their modified percentage chance, opens it in a Pulse.

## Potion of Longevity

This transparent crystal phial contains a teal potion with swirls of
pearl and weighs 3 oz. Drinking the potion reduces the imbiber's age
by 1 rollup D12 years to a minimum age of thirteen. Taking a one of
these potions subsequently requires a Break 100 + EN roll to avoid
being poisoned. If they avoid being poisoned, then they may make
another age reduction roll as described above. Otherwise, they lose
half their EN, which can only be recovered by Natural Healing, and no
other Potions of Longevity will work for them.

## Potion of Enhanced Restoration

This transparent glass vial contains a grey-green potion with dark
sparkles and weighs 2 oz.  Drinking the potion terminattes the effects
of any potion and restores sixteen FT lost from any cause. It does not
cure poison beyond, perhaps, restoring lost FT.

## Staff of the Woodland

This oaken quarterstaff weighs 3 lbs. It is shod with horn, and living
mistletoe winds around its shaft. It has a base Strike Chance of 67%,
and inflicts base damage of 1 rollup d10 + 5, dealing C-Class melee
damage.

- If the wielder has Rank 5 with this weapon, they may wield it
  one-handed.

- If the wielder attains Rank 10, the base damage increases to 2
  rollup d10 + 5.

- If the staff is wielded by a Druidic spellcaster, the Base Chance of
  all Spells and Rituals they know is increased by 10.

Once per day, the wielder may choose one of the following effects:

Woodland Concealment
: The wielder may use the surrounding woodland to Hide the Tracks of a
  number of entities equal to their Rank in Ranger. This costs 1 FT
  per concealed entity and lasts for a number of hours equal to their
  Rank in Ranger. This concealment requires but a Pass Action.

Tree Form
: The wielder may assume the form of a sheltering rowan tree, 30 feet
  tall with a 30-foot wide canopy. While in this form, they may
  attempt to conceal others beneath their leaves with a Stealth
  roll. Detect Aura will reveal that the wielder is not an actual
  tree.

Spell Surge
: The wielder may increase the Rank of a spell by two. This affects
  its Range, Base Chance, and Damage. This requires a Free Act.

### Investment Properties

The staff is a valid target for the Investment Ritual when storing the following spells:

- Converse with Animals
- Converse with Plants
- Armour of Earth
- Enchanting Plants
- Wall of Thorns

A total of up to twelve spells may be stored in the staff. They cost
the same as if invested in a scroll but are triggered as a Magical
Cast Action on their wielder’s Unengaged Initiative.

Anyone who knows the Investment Ritual and any of the listed spells
may store them in the staff.

## Staff of the Python

This redwood quarterstaff weighs 3 lbs and is shod with bronze. It has
a base Strike Chance of 61% and base damage inflicts one rollup D10 +
4 C Class melee damage.

If the wielder has Rank 5 with this weapon, they may wield it
one-handed.

If the wielder rolls in the range of an A Class Specific Grievous
injury then this is legal, as is a C Class Specifici Grievous injury.

Once a day as a Pass Action, the wielder may throw the staff to the
ground and it will become a massive python eleven yards long and under
their control, which will act on its own Initiative Value. It may be
directed by the wielder as a Free Act, even return it to its staff
form. If the snake dies, then the staff is shattered. Otherwise, it
will be restored to full health the next time it is summoned,
generally speaking.

## Ring of Wound Closure

This brass ring weighs 2 oz, has a flat, lozenge cut rhodochrosite
stone set into a bezel, and must be worn on the left thumb for it to
be effective. Detect Aura will reveal its primary magic is "natural
healing".

Once it has been worn for a week, the bearer reduces the effect of a
bleeding wound by one. This applies to EN loss as a result of falling
below 0.

The bearer recovers EN at three times the normal rate.

## Ring of Water Walking

This ring of pale blue glass has curves carved into the band as of
waves and weighs 1 oz. It must be worn on the least finger of the left
hand.

Once the ring has been worn for a week, the bearer can walk on the
surface of water as if it were solid and non-slip. This effect lasts
for 30 minutes and costs the bearer 3 FT.

They may travel at their normal TMR, however reduce TMR by 1 for every
foot above 3 in wave height. In rough waters, Agility rolls may be
required (unless crawling).

## Amulet of the Blue Pearl

This pearl is set into a silver pin, worn at the throat, and weighs 3
oz. The silver setting costs 100 sp.

Once per day, the wearer may cast the same spell they cast in the
previous Pulse, without needing to Prepare it again.

If the pin is crafted from ithildin instead of silver (raising the
cost to 3,600 sp), the wearer may repeat a spell twice per day instead
of once.

## Figurine of the Silver Raven

This small silver statuette of a raven is 10 cms tall, and weighs 7
oz. It may be called upon once ever other day at a cost of 5 FT, which
may Stun, whereupon it will turn into a large raven of silvery hue at
the owner's feet and serve them for twelve hours. It is about the size
of a turkey.

It is friendly to its owner, understands their language and obeys
spoken commands. If not instructed, it will defend itself but take no
other action. It can be returned to its figurine form by utterning a
Word of Power (requiring a Pass Action).

It may be directed to an entity that the owner knows and that is close
enough for it to fly to. It will deliver a short, simple message and
then fade away.

and Close weapon damage. This lasts for 6 Pulses. Drinking from the
flask empties it until after the next dawn.


## A Topacious Stone

This dull, yellowish stone contains several inclusions and weighs
approximately 9,237 carats. It is shaped like an oblate sphere
measuring about 10 cm in diameter.

An artisan gem-cutter or lapidary can transform it into a brilliant
faceted canary-yellow gem according to the following table:

Rank   Carats     Value (sp)  Diameter

# Dragon, Balrog and Ophanim loot

## Phantasmal Crown

This appears to be a crystal diadem but is, in fact, an organ ripped
from the body of a creature not known to mortal men. It weighs 2
lbs. If it is worn then it provides the following bonuses:

+5 to the Base Chance of any spell that creates a force or object of
Phantasmal nature (Phantasm, Flash of Light, Illusion of Food, Static
Illusion, Personalisted Illusion, Illusionary Wall, Illusionary
Cloaking, Illusory Fog, Illusionary Animal, Illusionary Bolt, Illusory
Creation, Disguise Illusion, Illusionary Euphonia, Illusion of
Metamorphosis, Hallucination, Heroism, Illusion of Innocence, Maze,
Illusion of Metamorphosis, Illusion of Mist, Illusion of Multiple
Images, Nightmare Illusion, Illusionary Aura, Illusionary Terrain).

When cast upon the wearer, Heroism will stack with the Force Shield
spell, and the duration of both is tripled.

When the wearer Casts Mind Shield, in addition to its other effect,
the spell reduces damage to Willpower by 1 + 1 for every Rank that is
prime. At Rank 20, one more point is reduced.

The wearer receives one less point of magical damage but not damage
inflicted as a consequence of a Strike Check.

## Dragon's Teeth × 63

Each of these teeth weigh an oz and there are 63 of them. They may be
sown on a battlefield, whereupon each will grow into a warrior with
the following stats:

Their Defence is 35 and their Magic Resistance is 40%.

The warriors will fight loyally under the command of whoever sowed
them, always succeeding when forced to make a morale check but will
last no longer than a minute.

It takes a Pass action to sow the dragon's teeth, and as many as
(Military Scientist Rank - 2) may be sown on any given day. The teeth
may be sown in one action or one at a time.

## Balrog Fork

The fine spinal segments of the balrog may be fashioned into a weapon
that will collapse down and lock into a form somewhat like a
trident. It is 7 feet long and weighs 5 lbs. The three tines are
barbed and when unlocked, allow the wielder to use their MD to grab at
things. Fine manipulation is not possible.

The fork is considered a 1 or 2 handed pole weapon. The base Strike
Chance is 61%, the base damage is 2 rollup D10 + 3, inflicts A, B or C
Class damage, and provides an Engaged Initiative Value bonus of 12.

The wielder may take a Free Act and change the properties of the
weapon, so that it is a long, flexible chain weapon with a claw-like
appendage. This will reach up to 5 hexes away, and may deliver an
attack or grab something about the size of a human limb or head.

In this form, the base Strike Chance is 47%, the base damage is 1
rollup D10 + 5, and the weapon inflicts B or C Class damage. If a grab
is attempted, the wielder must successfully Strike the target and make
a 3 × MD check - distance in feet. Those grabbed by the weapon may
attempt to shrug it off by attempting a withdraw from Close combat
manoeuvre.

The weapon is Ranked as a Lasso, the PS minimum to wield is 14 and the
MD minimum is 18.  Strike Chance increases according to the following
schedule:

Rank           0    1    2    3    4    5    6
---            ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---
+SC            0    +2   +3   +5   +7   +11  +13
Cumlative +SC  0    +2   +5   +10  +17  +28  +41

## Balrog Tail

The cord from the balrog's tail may be extracted to make a whip which
extends out fifteen feet and weighs 3 lbs.

The base Strike Chance is 47%, base Damage is 2 rollup D10. If the
Strike Check result is a prime and a successful Strike, the whip
cracks for an extra rollup D10 damage.

The hand wielding the whip has its MD increased by 16 and the wielder
may extend their sense of touch down its length.

Bonuses to PS do not increase the damage of this weapon.

## Balrog Scale

The cracked and friable hide of this balrog has formed into irregular
but horn-like scales. Each is about 2 centimetres thick, are vaguely
half-moon shaped, and vary in size from 1 foot by 18 inches to 2 feet
by 3.

They may be made into bucklers, small round or large round shields of
the following properties:

Shield                Weight     DEF per Rank     MD penalty
---                   ---        ---              ---
Buckler               1.5 lbs    3%               0
Sml Rd Shld           2.5 lbs    4%               -1
Lg Round              5 lbs      5%               -2

## Balrog Claws × 8

These claws may be shaped into blades that will not allow a hilt to be
attached. Magical throwing knives can be made from them, with the
following base properties:

Strike Chance: 53%, Damage: roll D10. 1 - 4 = 5 damage, 5 - 7 = 10
damage, 8 or 9 = 15 damage, 10 = 20 damage. The daggers inflict A or B
Class damage and their maximum range is 12 hexes.

Once they have been thrown, they turn to smoke and stream back to
their sheath, which takes about 3 Pulses.

## Balrog Spurs × 2

These curved, hornlike blades are 19 inches long and have a reverse
blade like a cat's claw. They may not be thrown, but may be wielded as
magical daggers and they have otherwise normal properties, except that
they inflict A or B Class damage.

If wielded together, then the wielder is considered ambi-dextrous,
their base Strike Chance is 47% and base damage is 2 rollup
D10. However, Strike Chance is increased by 7 per Rank instead of 4,
and if one dagger misses, then it will deliver a FT blow. If the
Strike Check is successful and it is a prime number, the spur
detonates for an extra rollup D10 damage.

If both miss, nothing special happens.

## Balrog Sinews

The sinews may be woven into a fine but incredibly strong line which
has a breaking strain of 2 metric tonnes. It is 90 feet long, and
weighs 3 lbs.

If the user takes a Pass Action, the line will turn to a wispy thread
of smoke and pour itself into a pouch, which will take about a Pulse.

## Balrog Eyes

These transparent, watchful, oval crystals of red and black may be
enchanted with the Create Crystal of Vision Ritual. Once a day, it may
be used as a Crystal of Vision or as if a Ritual of Flame Sight had
been successfully performed, but not both.

Infravision and Pyrogenesis may be used through the crystal, range
counting from the point of view.

## Balrog Teeth × 60

These teeth are very hard, and each one weighs half a pound.

They may be thrown to the ground and crushed under heel. This has a
chance of 83%, which may double, triple, or backfire. The following
Pulse, a Rank 20 Wall of Fire will spring up centred on the crushed
tooth, but having the proportions that the user wishes as outlined by
the spell (Section 21.6 S-13).

## Eyes of the Ophan

### The Eye of Reformation

This eye is an opal in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. Until it is used, it sheds a
green light out to about three metres in a cone about 30 degrees
wide. If the bearer plays the light on an entity with MA for a minute,
it will have its personality changed, if it is holy or unholy, to the
opposite, which will exhaust it.

### The Eye of the Exquisite

This eye is a pearl in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. Until it is used, it sheds a
nacreous light about the wearer. A viewer who considers the race and
gender of the wearer sexually appealing will adore them if they are
within two metres when it is used. Normally, there is no Resistance to
this effect.

This eye may be recharged if the wearer plucks out their own eye and
places it in the bezel before the next dusk, dawn, noon or midnight.

A figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
-1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. In addition, they reduce
their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by 30.

Any attempt to regenerate the organ lost in this way will fail unless
2,500 Experience is paid to the Eye of the Exquisite.

### The Eye of Departing in Safety

This eye is a sapphire in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. The sapphire protrudes
noticeably from its setting.

When held in a fist and a Magical Fire Action is performed, it
unleashes searing blue rays of light at up to 1D12 entities or objects
of up to size 6 that are in direct line of sight and within 300 feet.

The Eye has two possible uses.

If a destination was previously stored in the Eye (a process that
takes one hour), all targeted entities/objects and the Eye itself will
instantaneously travel to that location. This teleportation can be
blocked if the path is obstructed by Bound Earth or Cold Iron.

If no destination is stored, the targets and the Eye are instantly
consigned to an "illimitable darkness", never to return.

Upon arrival, the user must pluck out an eye immediately to recharge
the device. If this is not done, the Eye of Departing in Safety
becomes permanently drained and useless.

Regardless, the Eye cannot be used again until the next Dark of the
Moon has passed.

A figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
-1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. In addition, they reduce
their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by 30.

Any attempt to regenerate the organ lost in this way will fail unless
5,000 Experience is paid to the Eye of Departing in Safety.

### The Eye of Undersight

This eye is a larimar in a lenticular orichalcum bezel about three
centimetres long and weighing two ounces. The stone is translucent,
milky, and contains bluish swirls.

The bluish swirls are visible and will attend the bearer for as long
as it is not used. They are separately detectable in their aura and
may be interrogated by such entities as are wise in these matters.

Detect Aura will reveal it as magical, and the nature of the magic
being to do with revealing things.

When it is used, it projects a cone of silvery light with an internal
angle of 30 degrees and that extends for 36 metres. Any entity or
object concealed by shifting planes or any dimensional threshold (but
not boundaries) not normally visible will be revealed by this
light. Entities or objects concealed by illusions or other means are
not revealed. Using it will exhaust the Eye.

### The Eye of Kra of the Menninkäinen

This eye is an unworked piece of amber in a lenticular orichalcum
bezel about three centimetres long and weighing four ounces.

When it is used, the Eye ignites with red, yellow and orange flames,
and can be used to pull objects that weigh less than 1,000 lbs and
that are within a hex towards the user, or push them away that
distance. Doing so drains the user's PS by one for each Pulse it is
active. PS lost in this way recovers at a rate of one every three
days.

When the user stops paying the PS cost, the Eye becomes inactive and
if the bearer does not pluck out their eye by noon so as to recharge
the sliver of amber, the Eye will be permanently drained. In any case,
it may not be used for until after noon of the next Sunday.

A figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
-1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. In addition, they reduce
their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by 30.

Any attempt to regenerate the organ lost in this way will fail unless
1,500 Experience is paid to the Eye of Kra of the Menninkäinen.

## Disruptor Cannon

This complex device weighs 1,200 lbs, and is supported by an armature
that is made from antimony-hardened lead and bronze. Planes of
transparent glass in shades of red and yellow, are attached by slender
quills of Gla'aki to gears and wheels which rotate around a narrow,
central(ish) column the width of a dragon's eye. From this, at an
angle of 89 degrees, a barrel made from a metal that is the colour of
headaches and nausea extends as far as a healthy man in the prime of
his adulthood can urinate. Every time the device is touched, it drains
1 FT, but if touch is sustained, will not drain for another five
minutes.

A Mechanician who has learnt Glassworking, Chronometers, Fine
Materials. Spell Containment, Siege Weapons and Experimental
Engineering (Energy Weapons) may repair this weapon which will cost 15
guineas. A Mechanician who can teach Experimental Engineering (Energy
Weapons) will charge like a wounded bull and likely involve Greater
Summoners. The material value of the Emitter alone is 300 guineas.

When it is repaired, it may be used to deliver siege damage to a
target 1000 hexes distant. Damage attenuates after each 100 hexes by
one. Energy shields are twice as effective against Disruptors,
although force shields are ignored.

There is space for three human-sized entities to operate the weapon,
one of whom aims and fires the weapon. The weapon draws 50 FT to power
the weapon which can came from any or all of the three in any
proportion. The Gunner's Rank in the Disruption Spell determines the
Cast Chance and base Siege Damage of the Disruption effect is 1 rollup
D10 + Rank, which destroys the bonds between molecules in the area of
a megahex. If the Gunner's Rank is 15, an extra rollup D10 is rolled,
and a final one at Rank 20.

Once fired, the cannon will be unready for three Pulses.

A cube of basalt five foot on a side has around 50 Siege points.

## The Subtle Tongue of Glaurung

This crimson tongue is just over seven cubits long, as thick as a
stone mason's paired thumbs and the last two cubits are forked. It
weighs 15 lbs 11 oz. It regenerates inevitably and cannot be destroyed
except by magic that heralds the Apocalypse.

It may only be stored in a heavy glass half-graal that is one cubit
wide and one cubit high on the inside. The wall must be at least as
thick as a stone mason's paired thumbs and the base, twice that.

Twist the tongue as of the workings of Logres, so that it is entirely
compassed by the vessel. Then pour onto it 300 guineas of molten
silver, thus to visit righteous vengeance upon it.

The tongue will express intemperate growth on a Tuesday thereafter,
unless it is oppressed by as much Hydrargyrum as a pair of healthy
goats might produce in milk, which will render the intemperateness
into an exudate. The exudate will pass through the amalgam, resting
upon the surface of the metal. A gathering spoon of whitemetal or
copper that is unloved should be used to harvest the exudate, and for
this work the direction of a boy of twelve is considered
reckless. Once gathered, the exudate should be decanted into a vessel
of glass the size of the head of a boy of twelve, and then the
gathering spoon should be thrown a great distance. The operant is
advised to affect a non-chalant but brisk pace and progress elsewhere.
Collecting a boy of twelve who might have observed the operation and
could act as a witness is considered wise alchemical practice.

When the community has returned to tranquillity, the exudate can be
poured over a comb of the Singing Bees of Jiroth with a root of
licorice in the shape and size of a man's hand, keeping it in darkness
for at least a year. At the end of this time, this potion will be
created, and its Rank will equal to the amount of exudate that it
contains to a maximum of 20.

## Philtre of Silver Tongue
Duration
: 20 minutes + 2 / Rank

Target
: Sentient entity

This glass phial is chased in silver and weighs 5 oz, and the top
unscrews so that the contents can be poured into a glass of brandy of
figs and drunk.

Everything that the Adept says becomes more convincing and
believable. This ability does not force listeners to believe the
Adept, and obvious lies where there is evidence to the contrary will
be quickly dismissed. But in the absence of such evidence, or when the
lie is not blatant, listeners will tend to take the Adept at their
word. All natural or magical abilities that are normally able to
determine whether the Adept is lying or telling the truth suffer a
negative modifier to their Base Chance of 20% (+ 5 / Rank).

Those abilities that always work or have no BC may be presumed to have
a BC of 100% for these purposes. In addition, no magical ability is
able to coerce the Adept to speak truthfully.

It takes at least three hours for the alchemical vestigia to be shed
from the body, occasioning the passing of water, and taking another of
these philtres within that period has a chance of 1, 2 or 3 on a D10
of generating a toxin of the ephemera which will inflict damage
according to the following schedule: D10 roll of 1 = 1 damage, D10
roll of 2 or 3 = 2, D10 roll of 4 - 6 = 3, otherwise 4 damage. Damage
is rolled each Pulse that it is in effect, and the duration is
determined by the DM who rolls a D10. If an antivenin is taken, this
will increase the damage and duration by 1 but otherwise have no
effect.

## The Plaque of Midnight

The image of a slender, silver crescent on a black bacground is
painted on this slim plaque of dark red leather weighs 4 oz. It is a
Trump of the Deck of Rogues.

The card holder may play this Cartum Arcanum at a cost of 1 Midnight
to create a megahex-sized zone around them which will visit upon those
inside the effects of that Aspect, and which will last for twelve
Pulses.

They may play the Trump reversed on an area of a megahex that is up to
15 hexes distant at the same cost. Anyone who is performing an Action
or series of Actions from the Professions of Thief, Spy or Assassin
will be outlined in soft, silvery light amd be the cynosure of all
eyes. Stealth, Invisibility, Walking Unseen, Blending or Unremarkable
Appearance will be immediately ended and may not be begun for twelve
Pulses.

The card holder may gather 1 Midnight on the last night of the Dark of
the Moon, but it will only hold 1. If they sacrifice 2,500 Experience
to the cartum, they may increase it to 2, but this can only be done
once per season or adventure, whichever is the least, and the cost
doubles each time.  Incantations

## Eye of Glaurung

The eye weighs about 53 lbs and is 17 inches in diameter.

It may be enchanted by the Ritual of Creating Crystal of Vision, and
it will behave as a normal Crystal of Vision, regardless of any
refinements the Enchanter may have. This crystal may not be used to
see into the future, but the duration of its surveillance is
doubled. In addition, if a viewer would otherwise be able to see an
object or entity that is Walking Unseen, Blended, Invisible or of
Unremarkable Appearance, they will be revealed in the crystal 75% of
the time.

## Dragon Scale  Shield

This shield was made from a large dragon scale. It is about 2 feet
long by about 18 inches wide. It is very light and very strong.  At a
cost of 12,000 sp and requiring the arts of a Rank 9 Armourer or
Lindener, it has been made into a shield with the following
properties:

- It weighs 5 lbs, penalises MD by 2 and provides 5 points of Defence
  per Rank in Shield.
- Once a day, it is a legal target for an Armour of Earth spell. This
  magic does not add to Defence, however, any Grievous Blow to the
  target will dissipate the spell. In that case, however, the specific
  grievous injury will not be applied to the target.
- Damage from each successful strike is reduced by 1, and this applies
  to everything except poison, disease, drain, Disruption, Putrid
  Wound, Necrosis, Torment or similar.
- If the shield is cloven or damaged such that at least half of it
  remains, a Trollskin spell may be cast over it taking at least 10
  hours of Ritual Spell Preparation. This will restore the shield.

## Dragon Scale Buckler 

This buckler was made from a large dragon scale . It is about 18
inches long by about 15 inches wide. It is very light and very strong.
At a cost of 12,000 sp and requiring the arts of a Rank 9 Armourer or
Lindener, it has been made into a shield with the following
properties:

- It weighs 2 lbs and provides 3 points of Defence per Rank in Shield.
- Once a day, it is a legal target for an Armour of Earth spell. This
  magic does not add to Defence, however, any Grievous Blow to the
  target will dissipate the spell. In that case, however, the specific
  grievous injury will not be applied to the target.
- If the shield is cloven or damaged such that at least half of it
  remains, a Trollskin spell may be cast over it taking at least 10
  hours of Ritual Spell Preparation. This will restore the shield.

## Tincture of Sloe Plum × 6

This dark brown bottle is as long as a blacksmith's hand and weighs 17
oz.

The contents lose their special character after the bottle has been
opened for an hour. Until then, the first three drops of the contents
have the special property of restoring someone whose EN is sub-zero
but not dead to 4 EN. More will not help, although many claim that it
has medicinal value against the shock of a near death experience. An
entity cannot benefit from the special property of Tincture of Sloe
Plum more than once a week.

## Gyring Estoc

This long, slender splinter of steel has a hilt that is heavier and
longer than usual. It weighs 4 lbs, has a base Strike Chance of 57%
and inflicts 2D10 A Class damage, advancing as an Estoc. It ignores
the first 5 points of Protection, and if the wielder rolls a Strike
Check in the range of an Endurance Blow, a Possible Specific Grievous
injury or maximum damage on the dice, then the wielder unavoidably
loses an point of FT to drain, charging a device in the hilt which
causes the blade to "gyre" adding a further 3D10 damage.

This weapon prevents the use of non-racial magic while it is worn.

## Dacian Falchion

This long, heavy, curved blade of blackened steel is chased with
truesilver. Although it appears to be a two-handed sword, it is
treated as if it were a great axe, and advances as one.

It requires PS of 22, MD of 19, has a base Strike Chance of 73%,
inflicts 2 rollup D10 + 9 B Class damage. The wielder does not cut
with this weapon, instead they chop with it, and so defences which
apply against B Class swords do not apply to this weapon.

No more than 4 points of damage may be added to damage as a
consequence of PS, nevertheless there is no chance of weapon breakage.

Merchants, Weaponsmiths and Warriors will be able to tell this weapon
is worth well over 50,000sp.

## Orichalcum Escapement

This escapement weighs 15 lbs, is made from an orichalcum cog a foot
in diameter, 1/4 inch in thickness, attached to a rectilinear cuboid
frame of 9 inches × 2 feet × 1.5 inches, inside of which a pale grey
weighed rod 1 yard in length is attached.

If an Adept casts a spell that causes the rod to vacillate, then they
may reduce the force (i.e the weight × movement) or PS value of the
spell to as little as 1/ Rank in Mechanician but multiply the duration
by a similar Rank value.

## Draconic Jewels × 17

These gems are living rubies and sapphires have been taken from the
gall bladder of a dragon and been ground to perfect spheres. They may
be used as bearings at the point where metal connects to metal and
without any requirement for lubrication.

With respect to a clockwork device of a Mechanician's making, this
will increase its efficiency and accuracy while reducing friction to a
movement. 17 jewels will reduce such a device from about the size of a
large mantle clock to a cameo brooch.

An enterprising Mechanician may find other uses for them.

They are of poor gem quality, because, except for the perfect
sphericality, they have little ornamental value (700sp each) although
they are of substantial interest to Summoners and Mechanicians
(2,100sp each).

## Bridge & Movement × 3

Each bridge provides the framework on which each movement sits and is
made from living brass, silver and elemental bronze. Each bridge is a
semi-circle about a metre across at the base, weighs 18 lbs, the
movement being mechanical componentry, also made from living brass,
silver and elemental bronze, weighing a further 7 lbs.

Currently, such an automaton might have a PS of 13 and either an MD of
8 or an AG of 9, but not both. The maximum these values may be
increased is Rank in Mechanician.

Only a Rank 5+ Mechanician can modify or repair the movement, only one
of Rank 6+ can modify or repair the bridge.

## Mainspring × 2

This mainspring weighs 2 lbs and may be attached to an automaton to
give it a FT reserve of 7. The maximum this value may be raised to is
2 × the Mechanician's Rank. When this reserve is exhausted, the device
becomes inactive. The FT reserve may be restored by a Mechanician of
Rank 3+, and this will cost 3 FT + the FT value to be transferred.

Only a Mechanician who knows how to make Tempers and is Rank 5 or
higher can modify or repair the mainspring.

## Cogs & Gears × 53

Cogs and gears increase the PS, MD and AG of an automaton or the FT
value of a mainspring. Inevitably, however, they create points of
friction in the device where metal grinds against metal. The law of
diminishing return applies and the ensuing inefficiency quickly makes
a device impractical. Jewels may be used to offset this
inefficiency. The first point of PS, AG or MD costs 1 cog or gear,
mainsprings increasing the first point of FT value by 2. This doubles
for each further point of increase. Each cog (and attendant assembly)
will increase the weight by 7.5 lbs and the size by 1 cubic foot,
similarly doubling for each point of increase. Each throne jewel set
into the device will reduce the weight by 7 lbs and the size by 1
cubic foot.

## Mirror of Cyprian, retired

This shallow bowl of blackened silver covered in crazed obsidian is
half a cubit across and weighs 23 oz. Once, it held immeasurable power
and insight, but now only advances the effective Rank of counting by
two or weighing by one.

If a wall is relected on its surface but that wall is, or is part of,a
magical construction then this text appears upon it for all to see:

>Marble walls shiver beneath storm-lit skies,  
>Eagles scatter as towers groan and break.  
>Night swells with ash where the last prophet cries,  
>Each lamp extinguished by the rising quake.

>Men flee in droves from halls once gold and wide,  
>Earth drinks the wine spilled thick from shattered thrones.  
>Nations once bowed now turn the crimson tide,  
>Even gods falter, crumbling into bones.

>Tremble, O city, for your weight is known,  
>Every lie measured, every truth laid bare.  
>Kings stand as beggars on a plundered throne,  
>Empires decay beneath the vulture's stare.

>Long was your feast, now bitter is your bread,  
>Under the stars, your judgments are revealed.  
>Parchment and fire name the dreaming dead,  
>Hammered gates burst and never shall be sealed.

>Angels of ruin whisper through the air,  
>Rivers run black where hanging gardens sighed.  
>Serpents and dust nest in the Temple's stair,  
>Iron and silence where once hosts replied.

>Now Babylon drinks from the cup of night. 

# Crystals

## Song of Echo

This small murky, grey stone is the size of an elven warrior's
patience, and must be set in an earring of silver, which will cost a
guinea to have made. It will weigh an oz, and must be worn in the lobe
of the left ear for its magic to be effective, which will cost 1 point
of PC. This can be bought back in the usual way.

The bearer may receive three messages by means of this earring.

The wearer will hear such a message if each
- is prefaced with their Individual True Name
- is a simple message that doesn't exhaust the stone's patience

After three messages, the earring will forward no further messages but
they may recover one message by Purifying at dusk on a D10 roll of 7
or higher.

The earring may not hold more than three messages.

## 𒄿𒅔, The Watchful Inu

This lavender crystal is spindle-shaped and 1 1/2 inches long,
weighing half an oz. This inscription 𒄿𒅔 must be carved into it,
requiring the skills of a Rank 8 or higher Lapidary, Engraver or
Jeweler, who will charge 20 guineas for the service. If it is set into
an empty socket by a Healer of any Rank, it will regenerate it over
the period of an hour.

Any visual penatlties caused by the loss of an eye are relieved by
spending 1FT and lasts for an hour.

The Inu may be removed from the socket and pass what it sees back to
the socket owner, but it will not be able to draw upon their FT while
it is remote.

## Orb of the Sequestration of Harm

This polished, spherical chunk of crystal us three inches across and
is transparent. The bearer can spend five minutes Casting a Sinking
Doom spell upon it, which will last for 10 minutes. Damage they
receive that does not require a Strike Check may be directed into the
earth beneath their feet. They must maintain contact with the orb and
the earth when using it but could take it from or put it in a pocket
(requiring a Free Act) and still use it so long as duration remains.
The orb may not be concealed beneath clothing while it is being used,
but may be wielded in a hand, worn in hair or what have you, so long
as they are in flesh contact with it.

A total of 20 (+6 / 4 Ranks) damage may be avoided in this way, before
it's effects are dispelled and the excess applied to the wielder.

## Amethyst of Restoration

This splinter of amethyst is about 1 1/2 inches long, shaped like a
needle and weighs an ounce. It may be made into a hair pin with
silver, it will cost 100 sp. If it is made truesilver, it will cost
100 tsg.

While the pin is worn, the wearer may improve their FT recovery by 1
if the pin is made with silver or 3 if made from truesilver. It may be
used three times a day, but not during sleep and at least one hour
mast pass between uses.

## Horn of Glaurung

This curving, black horn is 11 feet long, a yard at the base, tapering
to a wickedly sharp hook. It is about 2 yards across and weighs 541
lbs. It may be hollowed along it's length to create a conical
horn. Legend has it that such a horn with seven embouchures might
cause perturbations upon the Abyss.

## Scales of Glaurung × 22

This fractured, crimson scale is the size of a family bible and weighs
3 lbs. It can be Invested with three spells. All spells must be
Invested within the same season, and they can only be Triggered in
reverse order.

The cost to Invest spells is as if this were a scroll. 

When the last spell is Triggered, the scroll crumbles to a reddish
ash.

## Shirt of Mithril Chain

This light shirt, woven from threads of mithril, weighs 11 oz, and is
sized for a humanoid of size 6. It provides 6 Protection (to a maximum
of 13), 8 Spell Armour, but does not apply to magical damage that
occupies a volume or a Gaze attack. It reduces damage from weapons in
the Sword category by 3.

Its magic will stack with one of a

- cloak
- coat
- jacket

but where it doesn't, the greatest effect applies. 

It may be worn beneath leather or metal armour, but in this case has
no beneficial effects.

It does not penalise AG. Indeed, upon the expenditure 10,000
Experience, the wearer may increase their AG by a sixth point if they
have not already done so, exceeding Racial maximum but only by 1. To
do this, they must drink a Potion of White Lead while wearing it and
return.


## Rod of Disjunction

This black, glass rod is two cubits long and weighs 5 lbs. 

When a spell of Disjunction is Cast through it, all Wards, Invested
items, Potions, Magical Traps, and permanent magics that need to be
triggered within the volume of effect will be permanently drained of
magic, including itself.

No Resistance check or saving throw is allowed versus this effect.


## Turf Ablaze

Upon drinking blood from the heart of Glaurung and surviving, Turf's
blood ignites on contact with the air (whenever he takes damage to his
Endurance). This makes it less attractive to carry grenadoes. An
unlooked for benefit, however, is that it makes it easier for Healers
to find him on the battlefield, who may observe the conflagration with
some concern or perhaps toast marshmallows.

Nevertheless, he has learnt the Generic True Name of Fire, which has
this effect.

By Using Ritual Spell Preparation to Cast Compelling Obedience, Turf
can Bind a soource of fire as large as 10 (+ 10 / Rank) cubic feet.
This fire may then be moulded and shaped as desired but with a minimum
of one foot thickness in any dimension. Regardless of the shape
created, the fire retains its normal heat and damaging properties.
Damage is as per a large bonfire or [D10 - 3] if the entity is within
one hex. Bound fire is unaffected by normal rains and winds short of
hurricane conditions, but may be extinguished by a dousing of water of
similar or greater volume than the fire.

If the Adept sacrifices 2 points of Endurance from a sentient as part
of the ritual, the duration is enhanced to 1 year (+ 1 / Rank).

If the Adept sacrifices 4 points of Endurance from a sentient creature
the duration of the Binding is permanent.

This Fire is bound to a specific non-movable item from which the fire
appears to issue (e.g. a ruby set in a wall, a line of runes on a
floor etc). Permanent Bound Fire can be suppressed for [21 - Rank]
minutes by a dousing of water of similar or greater volume than the
fire, attack with magical cold for more damage than the damage rating
of the fire etc. To dissipate a permanent Bound Fire the object to
which it is bound must be broken, destroyed or seriously defaced.

Turf may instil basic intelligence in a Bound Fire if desired and give
the entity thus created simple commands.  For the purposes of this
effect, his Rank in Compelling Obedience is reduced to his Rank in the
Generic True Name.

## Incandescent Tulip

Upon drinking blood from the heart of Glaurung and surviving, Tulip's
skin has become as black as soot, and her hair is a riotous cascade,
all the colours of flame. This does not increase her PB but does make
her noticeably exotic. If she takes a Magical Pass Action and rolls
under 1 × MA, her hair will ignite, rise up and lash about to the
limit of its length. Small masses of dry, flammable material will
catch on fire if brought into contact with it, anyone within a hex
will be able to read by the light shed, and she counts as a small
campfire.

In addition, her Ritual of Summoning Animals has been changed. If the
Check is successful then a number of small animals equal to her Rank
(minimum 1) are summoned. Alternatively, if she can speak its
language, she may summon a single non-sentient creature from these
categories:

- [Aquatics](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Category:Aquatics)

- [Common Avians](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Category:Common_Avians)

- [Apes](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Apes)

Exception
: the number of monkeys attracted from this category is equal to her Rank or less

- [Felines](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Felines)

Exception
: the number of domestic house cats, ocelots or wild cats attracted
  from this category is equal to her Rank or less.

- [Great Land Mammals](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Great_Land_Mammals)

- [Riding Animals](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Riding_Animals)

- [Creatures of Night and Shadow](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Category:Creatures_of_Night_and_Shadow)

Exception
: the number of creatures attracted from this category is equal to her
  Rank or less.

- [Lizards, Snakes and Insects](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Category:Lizards,_Snakes_and_Insects)

Exception
: the number creatures attracted from the category [Insects and
    Spiders](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Insects_and_Spiders)
    is the bracketed value after Number.

The animal she attempts to summon must be a native of the area and if
she chooses to vocalise her summons in the form of a loud shout or
call the Base Chance is increased by 25. Most insects and spiders are
deaf, however.


## The Douglas Blood

Upon drinking blood from the heart of Glaurung and surviving, Sir
Archibald's skin has become the colour of chocolate with an undertone
of amber, and the iris of his eyes have disappeared, leaving only a
small pupil and very white sclera. This increases his Distinctive
Appearance by 5 and makes him memorable. The chance of Detecting his
aura increases by 20, however, any die roll result which ends in a
prime automatically fails, regardless of the quality of the
result. Entities that notice this may make of it what they will.

When he extends his Blacksight, he can sense differences in ambient
temperature and identify heat patterns (or, more accurately, cold
patterns) out to the extent of its range.

He can extend his sense of touch through his Blacksight, too, but only
to the extent of his Perception value in feet.

## The Taste of Sin

Upon drinking blood from the heart of Glaurung and surviving, Tyndalos
knows the sin of dragons.  Now, greed lies at the back of his
intentions, driving him to acquire wealth, knowledge and power.  So,
no change there.

Whenever he is confronted with a choice regarding things of this
nature, and common sense, fear or decency lead him to decline a
particular endeavour, he must Break 100 + Willpower or immediately
attempt to make the acquisition. On such occasions, however, his
Endurance value increases by 20, returning to normal upon acquisition.

On the plus side, at a glance, he can see into the dreams of a
sentient entity and know something of the unseemly that they prize
most, which will require a 1 × Perception check. To investigate
further, he would need to spend at least an hour observing their
dreams which will occasion substantial alarm in the event that a
figure clad in yellow is discovered creeping around a bedroom.

The range of this ability is two hexes.

## A Staff of Life

This is a rod two cubits in length made from a dry and fragile femur,
weighing 7 oz.

It contains the spirits of 12 sentient, pregnant, humanoid females,
preserved at the moment of giving birth.

12    11    10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1

Cast Chance
: 35 + (MA Bonus + Enchantment)%

Range
: 75 feet

Duration
: 12 Pulses

Target
: Entity

Resistance
: None

Effects
: The target and any other entity within 50 feet will
  experience. simultaneously, the birth of a sentient humanoid, the
  death of a sentient, recently pregnant humanoid and then an instant
  later, the death of another sentient humanoid.

In the event of a backfire, regardless of other consequences, a
phantasm will appear next to the wielder, permanently reducing their
Endurance value by 1 rollup D10 - 4, then fade away.

## Skin of a Fallen Maia

This skin is somewhat shredded and weighs 11 oz. Iif it has a colour,
then it would be a pale azure. It is all that remains of a maia of
hidden wisdom who fell in combat against Glaurung.

A Rank 4 Seamstress or Tailor will take three weeks to craft it into a
cloak, and they will charge 50 guineas for their work. It will not
abide the touch of metal, dragons, dragonkin or those who have drunk
from a dragon's heartblood.

It is a focus for the Talent: Sense Danger. While it is worn on
adventure, the Talent may be advanced by the wearer as if they were an
Adept of the College of the Sorceries of the Mind.

If it is worn over leather armour or similar, it provides five points
of Protection, eight points of Spell Armour (which applies to the
breath weapons of dragons and dragonkin), one point of Damage
Reduction, which applies to everything except the special damage of
Specific Grievous injuries and poisons. The wearers Defence is
improved by one for every three points of Agility.

Once a day, they may exchange their MA for a value of 37, other
bonuses to MA from Purification and itemry stacking at the DM's
discretion. This will last for 12 Pulses and resets when the wearer
next Purifies at midnight.

For the purposes of determining how long it will take to repair, the
shawl has ten EN which it recovers at a rate of one point every three
days.

# Scrolls

## Treatise on Crushing Starfall

This tattered vellum scroll is old, sere and the ink is made from the
sepia of a kraken. Reading of it opens the mind, yea and it teacheth a
man who wieldeth a great rod how to have the heavens answer his call.

The warrior may attack their opponent, Striking for the head and
shoulders, may inflict half again as much damage as they normally do.

The attack requires a Strike Action or a Free Act, drains the
attacker's FT by 5, cools down for 4 Pulses.

It takes a week to learn the scroll's teachings, whereupon it will
burst into flames.

## Codex on Genuflection before the Altar

This tattered vellum scroll is old, sere and the ink is made from the
sepia of a kraken. Reading of it opens the mind, yea and it teacheth a
man who wieldeth a great rod how to make the unrighteous to kneel
before the altar.

The warrior strikes at the knee of their opponent, and by aiming at
their knee, halving their Strike Chance. If the strike is successful,
then normal damage is applied and they fall to one knee. The victim
will need to take a Pass Action to rise (as if from prone), but even
if they do, their TMR is reduced by 1.

The attack requires a Strike Action or a Free Act, drains the
attacker's FT by 5, cools down for 4 Pulses.

It takes a week to learn the scroll's teachings, whereupon it will
burst into flames.

## Discourse on the Stormbeat of Rebounding Hail

This tattered vellum scroll is old, sere and the ink is made from the
sepia of a kraken. Reading of it opens the mind, yea and it teacheth a
man who wieldeth a great rod how to make the unrighteous tremble and
give way in the face of piety.

The warrior strike at two adjacent foes in their front hex at a
reduction to their Strike Chance of 20. If the Strike is successful,
then normal damage is applied and his opponents must roll under 2 × AG
or fall prone.

It takes a week to learn the scroll's teachings, whereupon it will burst into flames. 

## El Enquiridió del Destreza Herética

This is a technique of mastery for rapiers, spears and estocs. It was
developed from the work of Don Jerónimo Sánchez de Carranza by Luis
Pacheco de Narváez. The seminal work emphasised geometry, mathematics
and philosophy in swordplay - especially circular footwork and
maintaining optimal distance. Pacheco de Narváez broke with this
doctrine, and instead introduced the idea of a magical square by means
of which the master predicted their opponent's position and their own.

It takes 2 weeks to learn these teachings, whereupon it will fade into
the scent of orange groves.

## La Paciencia del Escorpión

The master must not make a Strike until they have fallen below half
their Initiative Value, slowly advancing upon their foe at odd angles
and probing for weak points. They may use a Free Act to Strike,
increasing the Penetration value of their weapon by their Rank in
Mathematics.

The attack requires a Strike Action or a Free Act, drains the
attacker's FT by 5, and cools down for 4 Pulses.

## La Solución Cuadrática del Ángel

The master takes up a defensive posture, and evades versus their
opponents.  They must solve the geometric equation presented by the
position of his opponents, adding his Rank in Mathematics to their
Strike Checks. The master is thus set up to Riposte each attack that
missed him by 30 or more. A D10 is rolled for each opponent and his
Rank with the weapon is added, less the attacker's Rank.

-------------- --------------------------------------------------
3 or less:     Evader must pass next action.
4–7:           Evader may melee attack their opponent
8+             Disarm, 1 EN damage, evader may melee attack
-------------- --------------------------------------------------

The die roll result for the master's Riposte is reduced by their Rank
in Mathematics.

The attack requires a Strike Action or a Free Act, drains the
attacker's FT by 5, and cools down for 4 Pulses.

## Gilded Metal Plate

This metal plate has been gilded and depressions at the top mark out
the runes: Dûmpu-shatra gimb Angband

Once the gilt has been removed, a black iron plate 1 cubit long by
half a cubit in width is revealed, upon which writing is scored with
ink made from a dragon's blood.

It describes the fighting prowess of Ecthelion of the Fountains, his
dreadful skill with the war hammer and describes, with much woe and
gnashing of fangs, the suffering of his opponents.

An elf who peruses this work will find that the iron dissolves into
rust over the period of a week, but that if they spend another week in
contemplation of these lamentations, they will learn this technique:

## Gimbûrz-klatûrz uk Ek’thêl

They may Strike at plate armour or a piece of armour that is a
metallic plate by halving their Strike Chance. If the result on any
damage D10 is 6 or higher, and if the target takes any damage, then it
has been struck a resounding blow that will automatically Stagger
them, whereupon they may take no other Action until they use a Pass
Action to recover. The knell will be easily noticed two hexes times
the value rolled distant.

The attack modifies a Strike Action, drains the attacker's FT by 5,
and cools down for 4 Pulses.

# Tractatus Galeni de Regimine et Victu ad Audaces

Between the pages of a decrepit missal are seven loose sheets of
extremely fragile papyrus. One who reads the language of the Holy
Mother Church will be able to read it and benefit from the knowledge
therein.

This is a dietary plan designed to enhance the physical and mental
resilience of those who consistently adhere to it. To benefit, an
individual must consume at least two out of three of these meals each
day. If too many meals are missed, the process resets.

## Meal Preparation and Nutritional Value

The meals must be prepared by a character skilled as both an Herbalist
and a Cook. The Nutritional Value of each meal is determined as
follows:

Identify the Lower Rank: Compare the preparer's Herbalist Rank and
Cook Rank, and choose the lower of the two.

Add one for each Non-Prime Ranks: For each non-prime number in the
lower Rank (1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10), add 1 to the Nutritional Value.

Example
: If the preparer's Herbalist Rank is 7 and Cook Rank is 6, the lower
rank is 6. The non-prime ranks up to 6 are 1, 4, 6. So, the
Nutritional Value is 3 (1+1+1 for ranks 1, 4, and 6).

## Benefits of Adherence

For each day the dietary plan is followed, the participant's maximum
Fatigue (FT) value increases.  This increase continues daily until the
total increase in maximum FT equals the calculated Nutritional Value.

Example (continued)
: With a Nutritional Value of 3, the participant's maximum FT would
  increase by 1 on Day 1, by another 1 (total 2) on Day 2, and by a
  final 1 (total 3) on Day 3, reaching the maximum bonus.

Once the maximum Nutritional Value bonus has been reached, the
participant can maintain this increased maximum FT value by simply
continuing to consume at least two of these conditioning meals each
day.

## The Breakfast of Champions

A special meal, the Breakfast of Champions, can be prepared. When
eaten, this breakfast catalyses the effects of all previous
conditioning meals, providing an additional, immediate increase to the
participant's maximum Fatigue value.

The bonus is calculated as
: (Nutritional Value × Nutritional Value + Nutritional Value) / 2

Example (continued)
: With a Nutritional Value of 3, the bonus would be (3 × 3 + 3) / 2 =
  (9 + 3) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 is added to the participant's
  maximum FT value.

Note
: Consuming a Breakfast of Champions exhausts the current conditioning
cycle. However, as long as the participant continues to consume at
least two out of three meals from the dietary plan daily, they may
immediately restart the seven-day conditioning process to gain the FT
bonus again.

## Meal Logistics

These meals require a precise balance of nutrients, meat, fats, seeds,
nuts, and a wide variety of vegetables and fruits. The cost to prepare
these meals for travel is 5 gold shillings each and they weigh 9 oz.

## Foraging & Cost Reduction

Foraging for ingredients is possible during adventures, though
spending more than an hour per day on this activity provides no
substantial advantage. By carefully substituting foraged products for
purchased ones, the cost of the meals is reduced. This reduction is
equal to the preparer's Ranger Rank as a percentage. If the foraging
occurs in an area of their specialisation, this cost reduction is
doubled. All foraging benefits are subject to the Game Master's
discretion.

It will take a day to read each page and a day to meditate upon their
meaning. Upon the seventh day of reading, the pages will rise from the
missal and ascend a column of gentle light, restoring the missal to
its former glory. On the seventh day of meditating, they will
understand the Tractatus.

The missal is a spell rack, and, although the number of pages never
exceeds seven, it weighs 11 oz, it's covers are red, tooled leather
and it is embossed with gold.

Each page offers a new inspiring aphorism, which, if read, lets them
make a second attempt at one failed check. This will reset once the
next inspiring aphorism is read.


# Herbalism

## Teal Broadleaf Parsley (Uncommon herb)

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this herrb will fail
unless performed by a Rank 2+ Herbalist.  The leaves of this perennial
herb shine faintly blue if they have never been exposed to direct
sunlight.  It is difficult to grow and requires a place of deep shade.
It needs regular composting and watering, and soil with good drainage.
In terms of maintenance, the plant requires 180 hours of care a
season, divided by the Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time
that must be spent cultivating ut is 4 hours.  If this maintenance
time is not met or exceeded, the plant will wither and die.

## Teal Tincture of Parsley

To make an effective tincture from this herb, seven leaves must be cut
from the plant with a silver blade.  This must be done under moonlight
of a Monday evening, the leaves macerated in a white marble mortar
with a granite pestle.  Into the mortar, a cup of shadow wine must be
poured, and the macerate allowed to steep until the next moonrise.

The macerate must be poured into a copper pan and heated but not
boiled.  The fumes should be collected will form a teal distillate if
successful. This is sufficient for one dose. An Herbalist can create
one dose for every three Ranks, provided they have sufficient leaves
and other materiel.

Taking one dose of this tincture in a tisane of sage and honey once a
day for thirteen days has a 40% (+3 per Rank) chance to relieve the
patient of stones in the kidney or gall bladder.

## Woundheal Burdock (Uncommon herb)

This wide, spongy leaf can be applied to a wound, and will staunch one
point of bleeding.

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this herrb will fail
unless performed by a Rank 2+ Herbalist.  It grows easily and without
care so long as it is sufficiently watered.  In terms of maintenance,
the plant requires 80 hours of care a season, divided by the
Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time that must be spent
cultivating ut is 4 hours.  If this maintenance time is not met or
exceeded, the plant will wither and die.

A medicated bandage may be made from woundheal by tearing free three
leaves from a plant, and grinding them in a white marble mortar with a
limestone pestle.  Pour on a cup of apple brandy and steep for three
nights.  Pour the macerate into seven layerered sheets of common
cobwebs.  Wrap in a parchment spill and seal with wax.

When the seal is broken and the bandage applied to a wound, a D10 is
rolled and 1 added to the result for every three Ranks in Herbalist.
However, it is important to note that the bandage can only restore
damage inflicted by the wound it is applied to.  If the bandage
generates seven points of healing but the wound only inflicted five,
then only five will be restored.

## Summerbright Calendula (Rare herb)

This flower has bright yellow petals like spear heads and an orange
centre.

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this herb will fail
unless performed by a Rank 6+ Herbalist.  The scent and petals of this
of this perennial flower attract and support bees so that they remain
active all the year round.  It will only prosper in a high mana zone
that has a sunny prospect.  It requires 240 hours of care a season,
divided by the Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time that must
be spent cultivating it is 8 hours.  If this maintenance time is not
met or exceeded, the plant will wither and die.

## Bitterleaf Aloes (Unommon herb)

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this plant will fail
unless performed by a Rank 2+ Herbalist.  The leaves of this plant are
green, long, succulent and edged with thorns.  It is a robust plant
but requires a sunny prospect and well-drained soil.  It needs very
little maintenance but is aloof and will not abide crowding where more
than three other plants are within a megahex of it.  In terms of
maintenance, the plant requires 60 hours of care a season, divided by
the Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time that must be spent
cultivating it is 2 hours.  If this maintenance time is not met or
exceeded, the plant will wither but takes about two years of neglect
to die.  A single leaf is good for as much as five preparations,
however, although robust, the plant regenerates slowly.  No more than
two leaves should be harvested from a plant a year.

The latex of the fleshy leaf is yellow and bitter, edible but
unappealing.  Eating it regularly, however, is said to provide
protection againts fits, agues, convulsions and seizures.


## Bitter Condiment of Aloes

Take the latex of a single leaf, skin it and separate the aloe.
Gently heat it for three hours after the sun has reached its zenith.
Repeat this each day until it has been reduced to a rough brown
powder.  If the sun is feeble or the day inclement, this may take more
time, and if it has not been reduced by Thursday, then the attempt has
failed and must be restarted with new materia (success rate is usually
30%/day but varies depending on climate).

Mill the powder in a basalt mortar with a granite pestle and pour into
bottles as long as the middle finger of a seamstress and seal with
beeswax. This will hold seven doses.  The condiment will last
indefinitely and each leaf will produce five doses (+1 for every two
Ranks in Herbalist).

The condiment is applied to any food that is not a dessert.  If it is
eaten once a day for three consecutive days, then it provides a bonus
equal to two times the Herbalist's Rank to Resist fits, agues,
convulsions and seizures, including those caused by illness, backfire,
poison, spell or curse.  This includes things like Harming Entity,
Rigor Mortis, Agony, Torment, Hand of Death, Rune Curse (where
appropriate), Periodic Muscle Spasms, Migraines.  In addition, if the
affliction removes Actions, then, instead, their success chance is
halved.

After eating food dressed with the condiment once, then they must
Break 100 + WP × three to force themselves to eat it again, with the
factor reducing by one each subsequent day, failure indicating they
are unwilling to continue.  Any attempt to control, compel, bind or
otherwise force them to eat it will void the condiment's special
magic, although either Hypnotism or Illusion of Food, but not both,
will provide a bonus equal to Rank to the attempt to Break 100.  Once
the attempt has failed or dosages are exhausted, the effect wears off
and the process must start again.

## Draught of Clarity


>Read the sky at twilight's hue,  
>Only mix petals of the golden flower.  
>The leaves must glisten with morning dew,  
>First add a sprig of moonlit power.

>Word your spell as the draught is stirred,  
>To give it strength, chant thrice the name.  
>Find the roots of the whispering bird,  
>The elixir burns with a cooling flame.

>Truth.

>The brew will clear a muddled mind,  
>Twisted dreams it will untie.  
>Sister wisdom will you find,  
>Of truths unveiled beneath the sky.


Gather petals of chamomile in the hour after dawn and mugwort leaves
when the full moon is high. Take root of valerian on a Thursday at
noon.

Enough petals to fill a child's hand added to a cup of freshly boiled
water, then add seven of the mugwort leaves. As these steep, crush the
root and burn to ash. Add three thimbles of the ash to the cup once it
is cold.

Stir while focusing on what confounds you and ask your question three
times while stirring the mixture.

Strain through a linen sieve and drink while Purifying.

Success chance: Rank in Purification + two times Rank in Herbalism.

If the DM rolls beneath the success chance, the Herbalist makes use of
information they have already gathered and meditated upon to draw
accurate inferences. If the roll is greater than the success chance,
no inferences are drawn.

## Draught of Vengeance Toxin

Take thirteen petals from black hellebore that the Sun has never seen
and eleven leaves of stinging nettle. Thirty seven seeds from the head
of a single snake root.

Fill a tankard with boiling water and steep the leaves and seeds until
it becomes yellow. Make a sieve from the petals with a cobweb and
strain the contents of the tankard through it into a ceramic phial
coloured green. The draught will last until the end of the next dark
of the moon.

Once it is drunk, its effects last for Rank minutes or for Herbalist
Rank Vengeance attacks.

Each attempt to make a dose of this toxin costs three truesilver
guineas.

The toxin’s damage is calculated as: D10 – 7 + 1 per Herbalist Rank
(minimum 1 damage), so a Rank 6 Herbalist’s toxin would deal D10 – 1
(minimum 1) poison damage per attack received.

If three opponents deliver melee attacks and one other delivers a dual
attack, then but only two are successful, then the toxin is resolved
against those two. This counts as a single Vengeance attack.

The Vengeance toxin inflicts D10 - 7 + 1 per Herbalist Rank. A Rank 6
Vengeance toxin would inflict (D10 - 1) poison damage, minimum 1.

## Root of the Terpsichorean Angelica

This purple root is vaguely carrot-shaped, crisp and very sweet. It
grows in sunny prospects and requires regular watering, but is
otherwise a generous companion and shares the space well with
marigolds and beans. It requires the skills of a Herbalist of Rank 4
to gather, and requires 10 hours of care a season, divided by the
Herbalist's Rank. The least amount of time that must be spent
cultivating it is 1 hour and if this maintenance time is not met or
exceeded, it will wither and die.

The root may be steeped in a bath of clear fig brandy and laid down by
the autumnal equinox, and drawn no earlier than the next which will
produce a number of tinctures equal to three + Herbalist Rank.

If added to a meal or tisane, then whoever partakes increases their
chance to perform a feat of dance by the Herbalist's Rank.

## Phoenician Lavender

This shrub has a bright purple flower is hardy, prefers arid, sandy
soil and a sunny prospect. It needs a firm hand, else it will quickly
overwhelm the garden. It requires the skills of a Herbalist of Rank 4
to gather, and requires 18 hours of care a season, divided by the
Herbalist's Rank. The least amount of time that must be spent
cultivating it is 6 hours and if this maintenance time is not met or
exceeded, it will spread like a weed and outcompete more delicate
plants.

## Phoenician Incense

Into the cupped hands of a child of ten, pour enough lavender petals
to fill completely. Leave to dry under eleven sunny days from an hour
after dawn to an hour before dusk. Take sandalwood the size of a
fuller's thumb and grind together with the petals in a malachite
mortar with a diorite pestle until a fine powder is achieved. Stir in
as much gum arabic to form a paste, and pour into molds in the shape
of cones which is as deep as the least finger of a child of ten and
perhaps half that wide. Set aside near a baker's oven from one Monday
to the next. This is enough to make six cones.

Upon lighting, the cone will burn for an hour and sweeten the air of a
room as wide and as long as six strides of a lady of grace for another
three. Any who rests in this environ will restore one FT additional
per hour.

## Variegated Thyme

This ground covering, small-leafed herb has different coloured edges
depending on the season - pale green for spring, blue green for

## Thyme of the Season

Collect as many leaves and stems of the thyme that will fill the
cupped hands of a child of ten at midnight of a solstice or
equinox. On the next Wednesday, wash and dry them at dawn and leave to
stand in a warm dark place until Thursday noon. Wrap in muslin with
the skin of a lemon and three flowers of rosemary and direct a child
of ten to roll gently for as long as a Herbalist can abide their
complaints. Add to a round-bottomed flask of glass and pour over
enough farigoule or white brandy to immerse the contents and seal
it. Leave it in a cool, dark place for fifteen days from Friday,
shaking it for fifteen minutes each day. On a Saturday, distil and
capture the vapours in as many glass phials sealed in beeswax as the
Herbalist has Ranks. Each phial must be kept in darkness for two
seasonal festivals before it becomes effective.

When a phial is broken it will release a transparent mist over the
megahex, which will provide a seasonal bonus or penalty of 10 to the
die roll depending on the aspect of those in the area and which will
last for twelve Pulses.

## Claret Sage

This perennial has furred, dark red, aromatic leaves and thrives in
warm, dry environments. They prefer mildly acidic or neutral soil of a
sandy or loamy character. The soil must be well-drained and requires

legginess. It requires the skills of a Herbalist of Rank 4 to gather,
and requires 8 hours of care a season, divided by the Herbalist's
Rank. The least amount of time that must be spent cultivating it is 4
hours a season and if this maintenance time is not met or exceeded, it
will wither and die.

## Twinned Blooms

Two cuttings must be taken from a single plant. The cuttings must be
raised near two sentient entities who dwell in different locations.
Each must bleed directly into the other's bloom, which will inflict
three points of FT damage.

Each bloom will survive without care unless one or the other entity
dies, in which case both blooms will wither and die by the next
occasion of noon.
