>In the shadowed realm where mortal woe and spectral might entwine,  
>A tale of dark and light unfolds in the world’s bleakest design.  
>Where ruthless fiends and holy men in fate’s grand stage do play,  
>The next three moons will spin their threads in destiny’s display.

>A wraith of dread with burning eyes, in torment’s guise arrayed,  
>By darkened lord’s command doth seek the hearts of men betrayed.  
>In lands where sorrow’s seeds are sown, where fear doth reign supreme,  
>The fiend with cruel intent shall weave a harrowing dream.

>In the murky depths of witchcraft’s art, a matron wise and bold,  
>Foretold by agents three of yore, the tale of terror told.  
>She sent forth those with secret aims, where fiendish shadows creep,  
>To pierce the veil of devil’s schemes, where mortal souls do weep.

>Yet far within the twilight’s grasp, a noble count remains,  
>Whose life, though freed from serpent’s mark, bears past’s enduring chains.  
>This count, with quest of balance bound, through hidden paths shall tread,  
>May thwart the devil’s ruthless hand while soul debt he does shed.

>A seer, veiled in mystic shroud, with visions deep and true,  
>Hath seen an urgent embassy, a path of fate to view.  
>This mission bears a humble quest to seek the noble’s aid,  
>To glean what truths the count might hold, in the murk where shadows played.

>In distant coasts where merchants plot, and schemes of power weave,  
>An enterprising schemer stands, with papal ties to cleave.  
>His cunning gaze on shifting tides, with alliances entwined,  
>May steer the course of coming trials, with threads of fate aligned.

>Thus, as the lunar cycles turn and shadows deepen still,  
>The forces of the dark and light will clash with potent will.  
>With every stride and hidden move, their fates entwine and twist,  
>In the grand design of cosmic dance where none may long resist.

>And so shall fate unroll its scroll, with twists both sharp and sly,  
>Till ends are met and truths are known beneath the cosmic eye.  
>In this tumultuous sphere of war, where mortal and divine,  
>Will weave the strands of destiny, by cunning or design.
