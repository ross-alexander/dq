>In the shadowed realm where mortal woe and spectral might entwine,  
>A tale of dark and light unfolds in the world’s bleakest design.  
>Where ruthless fiends and holy men in fate’s grand stage do play,  
>The next three moons will spin their threads in destiny’s display.

>A wraith of dread with burning eyes, in torment’s guise arrayed,  
>By darkened lord’s command doth seek the hearts of men betrayed.  
>In lands where sorrow’s seeds are sown, where fear doth reign supreme,  
>The fiend with cruel intent shall weave a harrowing dream.

>In the murky depths of witchcraft’s art, a matron wise and bold,  
>Foretold by agents three of yore, the tale of terror told.  
>She sent forth those with secret aims, where fiendish shadows creep,  
>To pierce the veil of devil’s schemes, where mortal souls do weep.

>Yet far within the twilight’s grasp, a noble count remains,  
>Whose life, though freed from serpent’s mark, bears past’s enduring chains.  
>This count, with quest of balance bound, through hidden paths shall tread,  
>May thwart the devil’s ruthless hand while soul debt he does shed.

>A seer, veiled in mystic shroud, with visions deep and true,  
>Hath seen an urgent embassy, a path of fate to view.  
>This mission bears a humble quest to seek the noble’s aid,  
>To glean what truths the count might hold, in the murk where shadows played.

>In distant coasts where merchants plot, and schemes of power weave,  
>An enterprising schemer stands, with papal ties to cleave.  
>His cunning gaze on shifting tides, with alliances entwined,  
>May steer the course of coming trials, with threads of fate aligned.

>Thus, as the lunar cycles turn and shadows deepen still,  
>The forces of the dark and light will clash with potent will.  
>With every stride and hidden move, their fates entwine and twist,  
>In the grand design of cosmic dance where none may long resist.

>And so shall fate unroll its scroll, with twists both sharp and sly,  
>Till ends are met and truths are known beneath the cosmic eye.  
>In this tumultuous sphere of war, where mortal and divine,  
>Will weave the strands of destiny, by cunning or design.

## Talisman of Water

This small bracer is made from the amber hide of a giant seahorse and
a translucent blue gem about the size of a hen's egg. The stone has
whorls scratched into the surface and is poorly polished. It weighs
eight oz.

On the first day of each season, the wearer may store a number of
General Knowledge Water College spells into the gem which is equal to
their Rank in the General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of
Water Magic, and a record taken.

The Rank of the spells stored in the talisman are the same as their
Rank in the General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Water
Magic.  It is also a [Spell Rack](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/).

## The Sandglass of Polycarpus

This small sandglass will measure the passage of three minutes in tiny
grains of jade whenever it is turned over. It weighs thirteen oz and
is made from turned quartz and an extremely hard, marbled, dark blue
metal. It is unusually heavy.

The bearer may store Magical Pass Actions in the sandglass by reducing
their maximum FT value. This is done by Purifying with the sandglass
at dawn.

If one Magical Pass Action is to be stored, then the bearer's FT value
is reduced by one. If two Magical Pass Actions, then their FT value is
reduced by an additional two, if three, then an additional
four. Obviously, the amount FT value is reduced doubles for each
Magical Pass Action stored.

Only one Stored Magical Pass Action may be used in a Pulse, but it may
be combined with any other Action the bearer has available.

The bearer may begin to recover FT value as if recovering "tiredness"
FT once all of the Magical Pass Actions have been exhausted.
Subsequent Magical Pass Actions cannot be added to the sandglass until
it is empty.  It is also
a [Spell Rack](https://dq-nz.org/dqwiki/index.php/Spell_Rack).

## Figurine of the Diorite Mount

This rough-hewn stone figure is very nearly black with speckles of
almost luminescent white.  It appears to be a clumsy sculpture of a
horse, being ungainly and graceless. It will fit into the palm of a
large man, and weighs thirty one oz.

If a point of power is sacrificed to the figurine, then a mount may be
stored therein.  Once in any twenty four hour period, the mount may be
released from it. Storing or releasing the mount requires a Pass
Action.

## Callas' Arresting Gaze

Range
: 10 feet (+5 feet / Rank)

Duration
: Special

Experience Multiple
: 300

Base Chance
:  Automatic

Cast Time
: Magical Fire Action

Effects
: This magic does not normally miss, and neither can it
generate Double or Triple Effects. Callas has a gaze that she can fix
on an entity or an object that can fit inside a volume of one hex (+
one hex for every ten Ranks). Objects or entities of greater size
cannot normally be affected.

The effects of the gaze are Avoided or Opposed, not Resisted, and if
this is done, then nothing happens to them. For a target that
succumbs, however, the current Pulse does not end for them. They do
not lose Actions directly, however, abilities that reset at the end of
the current Pulse or the beginning of the next will not be renewed as
the Future is warded away from them. Similarly, entities afflicted
with continuous damage like bleeding wounds, Greek Fire, poison, the
End of Pulse Stun Recovery check, etc. will no longer experience them
until She lifts her gaze, and provided she maintains the cost each
Pulse. She cannot maintain the effect on multiple targets since she
can only gaze at one thing at a time but she can lift it at any time
without using any kind of Action at all.

Her gaze is Avoided if the target Breaks 100 and adds AG to the
result, or WP if the effect is to be Opposed.  This halves the Stat
involved or reduces it by ten, whichever is the least, and lasts until
the end of the next Pulse.  This magic draws one from a special
reserve in her 'heart'.  This starts at five, and may be raised by one
at the end of an Adventure or Season, whichever is least, at a cost of
two thousand five hundred Experience. It recovers as if it were normal
FT, but only after all normal FT has been restored.

: 3 months for every Rank that is prime

Experience Multiple
: 125

Base Chance
: 45%

Resist
: None

Cast Time
: 1 hour

Target
: Area, Livestock, Entity

Effects
: The ritual increases the richness of the soil of 1 acre (+ 1 acre /
Rank).  For the duration of the magic everything grown in that soil
will be proof against locusts, droughts, flooding, frost, and other
natural disasters.

unborn child's EN value by one, raising it by three at Rank 10 and
finally raising it by six at Rank 20.

It can also be cast upon 5 (+ 1 / Rank) livestock that are within

as rabies, dysentery, worms, and hoof and mouth disease for the

Blighting Crops or Spell of Pestilence.

## Weapon of Mettle (S-5)

: 5 feet + 5 / Rank

Duration
: 5 minutes + 1 / Rank

Experience Multiple
: 250

Base Chance
: 30%

Resist
: None

Storage
: Investment

Target
: Object

Effects
: This spell is cast over a weapon of the Adept’s choice, increasing
its strike chance by Rank% (minimum of 1). If it is cast upon a weapon
that inflicts A Class damage, then it increases the Penetration of the
weapon by 1 for every two full Ranks.  Penetration does not increase
damage, instead, it reduces the target's Protection. If cast upon a
swinging weapon (hafted B or C Class weapons and military pick), it
strengthens the weapon so that bonuses for excess PS can be applied
without possibility of weapon breakage, unless PS exceeds 40.  If it
is cast upon a weapon that inflicts C Class damage, then it inflict 1
extra point of damage for every three or fraction Ranks.  At Rank 20,
an extra D10 C Class damage is added.  Beyond the enhancement to
Strike Chance, none of these bonuses apply to B Class swords.

for the duration of the talent’s workings, see, hear, taste, smell and
feel the same things as their familiar, provided that their familiar
is within 15 feet (+ 15 feet / Rank) of their position.  This talent
allows no special communication with the familiar, merely the ability
to utilise their senses. The Adept must have already taken control of
the animalfor this talent to be effective.  It takes about 2 Pulses
(−1 / 5 full Ranks) for the Adept to tune in to the familiar’s senses.
If the familiar is killed while the Adept is using this talent, they
suffer magical backlash D10 + 10 damage due to shock. This damage can
Stun.

## The Speculon of Anak (S-SA)

a volume of non-living solid material to become as transparent as high
quality glass unless that material is ferrous in any way.  Otherwise
the material will retain its original characteristics.  One (+ 1 /
Rank) adjacent 1 foot cubes may be affected, and any dimension less
than one foot counts as one foot. The Adept may cause the volume to be
transparent from only a single direction, by reducing the BC by 10.

: The Adept may communicate with any natural and unenchanted, animal,
bird, or aquatic.  Whether this communication is verbal or symbolic,
and to what extent the communication may be carried is left up to the
GM’s discretion.  The Adept must specify at the time of casting what
particular type of animal, bird or aquatic is to be conversed with.
The spell must be re-cast to speak to another type of animal, bird, or
aquatic.

## Binding Earth (R-BE)

Duration
: 2 hours + 2 / Rank

Experience Multiple
: 500

Base Chance

elemental and cannot be used in any way to control an elemental.

example, Hands of Earth, Earth Elementals, Tunnelling.

## Ride the Wind (T-RW)

Experience Multiple
: 1

Cast Time
: Pass Action

Effects
: Corniger may Ride the Wind at his TMR (+ or − 1 for every four full
Ranks).  If he does not maintain his TMR, he falls.  At heights
greater than thirteen metres above the ground, he may call a wind that
will increase his movement rate to twenty miles per hour (+1 mile per
hour per Rank). His rate of climb is one hex up for every two
horizontal.

## Teal Broadleaf Parsley (Uncommon herb)

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this herrb will fail
unless performed by a Rank 2+ Herbalist.  The leaves of this perennial
herb shine faintly blue if they have never been exposed to direct
sunlight.  It is difficult to grow and requires a place of deep shade.
It needs regular composting and watering, and soil with good drainage.
In terms of maintenance, the plant requires 180 hours of care a
season, divided by the Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time
that must be spent cultivating ut is 4 hours.  If this maintenance
time is not met or exceeded, the plant will wither and die.

## Teal Tincture of Parsley

To make an effective tincture from this herb, seven leaves must be cut
from the plant with a silver blade.  This must be done under moonlight
of a Monday evening, the leaves macerated in a white marble mortar
with a granite pestle.  Into the mortar, a cup of shadow wine must be
poured, and the macerate allowed to steep until the next moonrise.

The macerate must be poured into a copper pan and heated but not
boiled.  The fumes should be collected will form a teal distillate if
successful. This is sufficient for one dose. An Herbalist can create
one dose for every three Ranks, provided they have sufficient leaves
and other materiel.

Taking one dose of this tincture in a tisane of sage and honey once a
day for thirteen days has a 40% (+3 per Rank) chance to relieve the
patient of stones in the kidney or gall bladder.

## Woundheal Burdock (Uncommon herb)

This wide, spongy leaf can be applied to a wound, and will staunch one
point of bleeding.

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this herrb will fail
unless performed by a Rank 2+ Herbalist.  It grows easily and without
care so long as it is sufficiently watered.  In terms of maintenance,
the plant requires 80 hours of care a season, divided by the
Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time that must be spent
cultivating ut is 4 hours.  If this maintenance time is not met or
exceeded, the plant will wither and die.

A medicated bandage may be made from woundheal by tearing free three
leaves from a plant, and grinding them in a white marble mortar with a
limestone pestle.  Pour on a cup of apple brandy and steep for three
nights.  Pour the macerate into seven layerered sheets of common
cobwebs.  Wrap in a parchment spill and seal with wax.

When the seal is broken and the bandage applied to a wound, a D10 is
rolled and 1 added to the result for every three Ranks in Herbalist.
However, it is important to note that the bandage can only restore
damage inflicted by the wound it is applied to.  If the bandage
generates seven points of healing but the wound only inflicted five,
then only five will be restored.

## Summerbright Calendula (Rare herb)

This flower has bright yellow petals like spear heads and an orange
centre.

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this herb will fail
unless performed by a Rank 6+ Herbalist.  The scent and petals of this
of this perennial flower attract and support bees so that they remain
active all the year round.  It will only prosper in a high mana zone
that has a sunny prospect.  It requires 240 hours of care a season,
divided by the Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time that must
be spent cultivating it is 8 hours.  If this maintenance time is not
met or exceeded, the plant will wither and die.

## Bitterleaf Aloes (Unommon herb)

Any attempt to take cuttings or seedlings of this plant will fail
unless performed by a Rank 2+ Herbalist.  The leaves of this plant are
green, long, succulent and edged with thorns.  It is a robust plant
but requires a sunny prospect and well-drained soil.  It needs very
little maintenance but is aloof and will not abide crowding where more
than three other plants are within a megahex of it.  In terms of
maintenance, the plant requires 60 hours of care a season, divided by
the Herbalist's Rank.  The least amount of time that must be spent
cultivating it is 2 hours.  If this maintenance time is not met or
exceeded, the plant will wither but takes about two years of neglect
to die.  A single leaf is good for as much as five preparations,
however, although robust, the plant regenerates slowly.  No more than
two leaves should be harvested from a plant a year.

The latex of the fleshy leaf is yellow and bitter, edible but
unappealing.  Eating it regularly, however, is said to provide
protection againts fits, agues, convulsions and seizures.


## Bitter Condiment of Aloes

Take the latex of a single leaf, skin it and separate the aloe.
Gently heat it for three hours after the sun has reached its zenith.
Repeat this each day until it has been reduced to a rough brown
powder.  If the sun is feeble or the day inclement, this may take more
time, and if it has not been reduced by Thursday, then the attempt has
failed and must be restarted with new materia (success rate is usually
30%/day but varies depending on climate).

Mill the powder in a basalt mortar with a granite pestle and pour into
bottles as long as the middle finger of a seamstress and seal with
beeswax. This will hold seven doses.  The condiment will last
indefinitely and each leaf will produce five doses (+1 for every two
Ranks in Herbalist).

The condiment is applied to any food that is not a dessert.  If it is
eaten once a day for three consecutive days, then it provides a bonus
equal to two times the Herbalist's Rank to Resist fits, agues,
convulsions and seizures, including those caused by illness, backfire,
poison, spell or curse.  This includes things like Harming Entity,
Rigor Mortis, Agony, Torment, Hand of Death, Rune Curse (where
appropriate), Periodic Muscle Spasms, Migraines.  In addition, if the
affliction removes Actions, then, instead, their success chance is
halved.

After eating food dressed with the condiment once, then they must
Break 100 + WP × three to force themselves to eat it again, with the
factor reducing by one each subsequent day, failure indicating they
are unwilling to continue.  Any attempt to control, compel, bind or
otherwise force them to eat it will void the condiment's special
magic, although either Hypnotism or Illusion of Food, but not both,
will provide a bonus equal to Rank to the attempt to Break 100.  Once
the attempt has failed or dosages are exhausted, the effect wears off
and the process must start again.

## Draught of Clarity


>Read the sky at twilight's hue,  
>Only mix petals of the golden flower.  
>The leaves must glisten with morning dew,  
>First add a sprig of moonlit power.

>Word your spell as the draught is stirred,  
>To give it strength, chant thrice the name.  
>Find the roots of the whispering bird,  
>The elixir burns with a cooling flame.

>Truth.

>The brew will clear a muddled mind,  
>Twisted dreams it will untie.  
>Sister wisdom will you find,  
>Of truths unveiled beneath the sky.


Gather petals of chamomile in the hour after dawn and mugwort leaves
when the full moon is high. Take root of valerian on a Thursday at
noon.

Enough petals to fill a child's hand added to a cup of freshly boiled
water, then add seven of the mugwort leaves. As these steep, crush the
root and burn to ash. Add three thimbles of the ash to the cup once it
is cold.

Stir while focusing on what confounds you and ask your question three
times while stirring the mixture.

Strain through a linen sieve and drink while Purifying.

Success chance: Rank in Purification + two times Rank in Herbalism.

If the DM rolls beneath the success chance, the Herbalist makes use of
information they have already gathered and meditated upon to draw
accurate inferences. If the roll is greater than the success chance,
no inferences are drawn.

## Draught of Vengeance Toxin

Take thirteen petals from black hellebore that the Sun has never seen
and eleven leaves of stinging nettle. Thirty seven seeds from the head
of a single snake root.

Fill a tankard with boiling water and steep the leaves and seeds until
it becomes yellow. Make a sieve from the petals with a cobweb and
strain the contents of the tankard through it into a ceramic phial
coloured green. The draught will last until the end of the next dark
of the moon.

Once it is drunk, its effects last for Rank minutes or for Herbalist
Rank Vengeance attacks.

Each attempt to make a dose of this toxin costs three truesilver
guineas.

The toxin’s damage is calculated as: D10 – 7 + 1 per Herbalist Rank
(minimum 1 damage), so a Rank 6 Herbalist’s toxin would deal D10 – 1
(minimum 1) poison damage per attack received.

If three opponents deliver melee attacks and one other delivers a dual
attack, then but only two are successful, then the toxin is resolved
against those two. This counts as a single Vengeance attack.

The Vengeance toxin inflicts D10 - 7 + 1 per Herbalist Rank. A Rank 6
Vengeance toxin would inflict (D10 - 1) poison damage, minimum 1.

## Hart/Hind (S-H/H)

Range
: Self

Duration
: 1 hour + 30 minutes / Rank

Experience Multiple
: 200

Base Chance
: 30%

Resist
: None

Storage
: Potion, Ward

Target
: Self

Effects
: The Adept may transform themselves into a Hart or Hind, depending on
gender, which is not fully manifest in the real world.  While in this
spectral form, they have, instead, a combined FT and EN value of 20 (+
5 per 3 Ranks, 60 at Rank 20).  Once this value is exhausted, duration
expires or they take a Pass Action to end the spell, they resume their
original form.  Damage inflicted to the spectral form does not roll
over to their personal FT and/or EN unless this would be sufficient to
kill them outright (i.e. combined FT & EN of the spectral form +
remaining FT + (1.5 × remaining EN)).

If they are under the effects of a Walking Unseen spell, then they may
not be clearly identified or directly magically targeted by sight
unless the Rank of Enhanced Vision, Witchsight or similar magic is
equal or higher.

While in this form, they can run overland at their TMR (+1 per 5
Ranks) and, over the course of a minute, enter a spectral trail where
their movement rate is 30 miles per hour (+1 mile per hour per Rank).

## Dominican Chainmail

This mail shirt covers a humanoid of size 6 from the shoulders to the
knees, and must be belted.  It weighs 42 lbs, reduces AG by 2, Stealth
by 15 and improves Magic Resistance by 15.  It provides Protection of
10, EN Armour of 1 and 3 points of Spell Armour.  However, the wearer
adds 15 to the result of any Cast Check, and any roll of "00" is
always a backfire, regardless of Cast Chance.

Once a day, and at a cost of 10 FT, the wearer may double their base
PS for three consecutive Pulses. Magical enhancements to PS stack but
are not doubled.


## Tabard of the Hounds of God

This white linen tabard has a black hound, rampant, breathing flames,
embroidered into it with thread spun from the sinews of a night gaunt.
It will fit any human, elf or orc, weighs four pounds and may be worn
over chain or plate armour.  Wearing this tabard penalises FT recovery
by one.  For example, if the wearer would normally recover three FT
from tea, then they recover two.  If the wearer avoids this cost on
three consecutive occasions, the embroidery rots and the magic is
lost.

The wearer takes one less damage from magic that drains life, and
their Defence is improved by seven.  In addition, they may increase
their half move TMR by one.  For example, if their TMR is five, then
their half move TMR would normally be three, but wearing the tabard
would make it four.

## The Discord Serpent

This is the Individual True Name of a unique entity, Zmey
Gorynych. There are only 21 Ranks available. In other words, every
Rank this Name is raised reduces someone else's Rank by the same
amount amount.

If the Spell of Name Change is known, and their Rank in the Generic
True Name 'Snake' is Ranked to 10 or higher, then they may assume a
dracoform with green and black scales whose properties are described
below. They may also assume the form of a green and black serpent as
long in feet as their Rank in the spell. The serpent will weigh
(length + (length × length))/2 in lbs.

It can fit through a gap which is no narrower than 1 inch (+1 inch for
every three feet of length).

Adept's WP   Adept's    10    3 + length/4   3

Weapons
: The serpent can bite in Close or Melee Combat

BC
: 61%,1 roll-up D10 + (length/3), A Class damage

The Bite is Ranked as a Short Sword

The damage the bite inflicts depends on the length of the serpent. If
the serpent is less than ten feet long, the damage dice only reflects
how much armour is defeated. If this is insufficient to penetrate
armour, then no venom is delivered. If the length is 10 feet or
greater, then the bite inflicts standard A class damage.

Venom from the bite is equal to 1 for every four Ranks in the Generic
True Name and each application lasts for D10 Pulses.

Every 4 Ranks in this Generic True Name 'Snake' increases PS, AG, EN
and PB by 1

The shade of the scales may be subtly altered to improve Stealth by
the Rank of the Generic True Name while in a natural terrain that is
not arctic.

The serpent has Racial Magic that lets it:

- see heat sources as faint as a mammal up to 25 feet distant even in
  complete darkness allows it to hold its breath for a number of
  minutes equal to its EN.
- meet the gaze of an entity that is half its weight or less and
  immobilise, unless the victim takes a Pass Action
- The serpent has a land TMR of 3 (+length/3), a swimming TMR of 4, a
  climbing TMR of 2, and a land movement rate of 50 yards per minute
  per five feet of length.

A battleform may also be assumed where the Adept assumes the shape of
a humanoid drake whose body is as long as their humanoid height and a
muscular tail half as long again. Their armour merges with their green
and black scales, but their other equipment is disposed around their
body as usual. When the Individual True Name is Rank 10 or higher,
membranous wings appear on the battleform's back and allow a limited
form of flight.

Changing between the serpent shape and the battleform requires a Pass Action. 

It provides 1 point of Damage Reduction (+1 for every 10 Ranks in the
Individual True Name) against all known forms of damage.

Every 4 Ranks in this Individual True Name increases PS, MD, AG, EN
and NA by 1.

Every 4 Ranks in this Generic True Name 'Snake' increases PS, AG, EN
and PB by 1.

The battleform has three heads, although only one can be manifested at
a time, and changing heads requires a Pass Action. At Rank 20 in the
Individual True Name, changing heads requires a Free Act.

Agon is not very smart but can breathe fire in a cone that is Rank of
the Individual True Name long in hexes and half that at the base.  It
inflicts 1 rollup D10 + Rank in the Individual True Name to everything
in the volume. Magic Resistance is not usually allowed against this
unless the victim is on the edge of the volume. Once used, Agon's
breath weapon recovers when a six on a die is rolled.

Spokononyy is not very brave but can transfix a victim by gazing
unless they succeed in a Break 100 roll adding 2 × their WP to the
result. If they fail, they may only take Pass Actions to remove the
transfixation. For every five Ranks in the Individual True Name, the
victim must make an extra Pass Action. Once used, Spokononyy's gaze
weapon recovers when an eight on a die is rolled.

Kusat is not very polite but has a bite that inflicts twice as much
damage as the other heads and can attack a target up to 10 feet
distant.

The Adept's player may check each Pulse to determine if a head's
weapon has recovered.

If the Discord Serpent is decapitated, then they have two chances in
three of manifesting another head, and if decapitated again, then one
chance in three.

Weapons
: Heads can bite in Close or Melee Combat

- Bite    BC: 71%, 1 roll-up D10 (+Individual True Name / 4), B Class damage, MC, Ranks as a  claymore
- Claw    BC:    57%, 1 roll-up D10 + 1 (+ Individual True Name/10), A Class damage, MC, Ranks as a dagger
- Tail    BC:    47%, 2 roll-up D10 (+Individual True Name / 4), C Class damage, M, Ranks as a whip. 

The Adept can deliver a claw/claw/bite routine or if other weapons are used, only a bite can be delivered.

The tail can make one attack into a rear hex of the Adept but does not count against their others since it is a Reflex Action. 

The wings have the following flight properties

- flying requires a clear space around the Adept of about a megahex.
- the Adept must spend 1 FT at the beginning of every Pulse that they intend to fly.
- the Adept must maintain an airspeed equivalent to TMR 7 (-1 for every three Ranks in the individual True Name) to avoid stalling and beginning to fall.
- maximum rate of climb is an angle of 45°, and each Pulse climbing like this costs an additional point of FT. Climbing at a rate of 1 hex per 2 horizontal hexes does not cost additional FT.

In addition, wings may be used to batter opponents up to 10 feet
distant or Melee Combat

BC
: 53%, 1 roll-up D10 + 2 (+ Individual True Name / 10), C Class
damage. ME, Ranks as a quarterstaff. Two wing attacks may be made
without penalty unless the Adept is using other weapons, in which case
only one wing attack is allowed.

## Incantation of Ley Line Traversal

Spell
: Earth Door + Earth Elemental

Range
: Rank × Rank × 10 miles

Duration:
Conc. 10 mins + 10 mins / Rank

Resist
: None

Target
: Earth Elemental

Effects
: This incantation of the Earth Door spell allows the Adept and 1
  person (+1 per 2 Ranks) to travel with them. An Earth Elemental is
  summoned, Controlled, and then when the Earth Door is Cast,
  instructed to keep it open, extending it back to a point the Adept
  can see or has committed to their Ley Memory. They will will travel
  to this destination through the Elemental Plane of Earth. From their
  perspective, they will be traveling at a walking pace, but in
  reality their movement rate will be up to Rank miles per minute.

Adding a location to the Adept's Ley Memory costs 1 PC, takes around
four hours, and can be bought back in the usual way.

Cost
: 3,000

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 4. 

## Incantation of Spell Magazine

Spell
: Smoking Magma

Range
: 25 feet + 5 / Rank

Duration
: Special

Base Chance
: 7%

Resist
: Passive

Target
: Object/Entity

Effects
: This incantation of Smoking Magma gains a number of Prepare Actions
  equal to 1 (+1 for every three Ranks) so that they may Cast a Magma
  Bolt, which will fly from their hand to hit an object or entity.
  Since the Prepare Actions have already been stored into the Spell
  Magazine, the Adept simply makes a Cast Action to Fire a Magma Bolt
  which inflicts 1 roll-up D10 + Rank fire damage, Resist for
  half. The FT cost is paid for each bolt, however.

The magazine lasts for 10 seconds (+10 seconds per Rank) or until all
Cast Actions have been used.

Cost
: 3000

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 3.

##  Spell Matrix

A Spell Matrix takes 7 half days of magical training to create.  They
must also expend Experience to create each of them.  The base cost for
a spell matrix is 1000 Experience divided by (the Adept's MA - 15).
If the Adept has less than 16 MA, they cannot create spell matrices.
The cost doubles for each new matrix bought.  There is no upper limit,
the Adept can keep buying matrices so long as they are willing to
spend the Experience.

Incantations of a spell must be racked before they can be cast by the
Adept. To rack a spell, the Adept must ritually cast it with its
particular incantation. If the spell cannot be ritually cast, it
cannot be racked

## Voidsilk Robe × 2

This robe is made from voidsilk, and is the colour of migraines. It
will conform in fit to anyone of size 6 or less.  The wearer must
sacrifice a point of EN to bind the robes to them.  Once bound, it has
the following properties:

- +1 WP
- 6 points of Protection and 8 points of Spell Armour which will stack
  with Natural Armour or that made from plant or animal fibres but not
  leather, wooden, ceramic or metal armour.
- Reduces damage by 1 point except versus Disruption, Putrid Wound,
  Necrosis, Torment, venom or similar.
- If the wearer is the target of a Defence spell, it increases that
  Defence by another 7
- The calculation for bonus to Magical Aptitude from Purification
  becomes 1 per four Ranks not 1 per five and 1 extra Magic Resistance
  for every four Ranks.
- The wearer may buy a point of spell casting FT for the robe at a
  cost of 1,999 Experience, which may be used (only) for the casting
  of spells or rituals. The maximum FT that can be stored is 10, and
  only one such point may be bought per season or adventure, whichever
  is least.
- If the robes are damaged, 1 point of Protection is restored at a
  cost of 3 EN which can only be recovered by Natural Healing.

## Mindflayer Belt × 2

This belt weighs 5 lbs and is made from five 5 inch by 2 inch sections
of a pale blue cairngorms, joined by dark green opaque links, made of
jade.  It may be draped over a shoulder by threading through a sturdy
epaulette, or worn around the neck like a stole and strapped into
position on armour, but must be securely attached.  It is as tough as
steel and as flexible as willow.

If the wearer spends 1 FT, this belt reduces their weight down to
1/3rd, 90 lbs becomes 30 lbs, etc, and Encumbrance will have to be
recalculated.  This effect lasts for 10 minutes, and can be renewed as
long as the wearer pays the FT cost.

## Storage Crystal x 2

This crystal is transparent and a pale yellow in colour.  It is a
regular duodecimal solid that is 12 cms across and weighs 1 lb.  It
can be used to store power or spell casting FT at a rate of 1 point
per 10 minutes of focused concentration during which no other activity
can be undertaken.

The crystal, currently, has a value of 0, being empty. To increase its
storage capacity to 1, the user must spend as many days as the next
prime value and the same value in thousands of Experience.  Thus, the
user must spend two days two thousand Experience to raise it from 0
to 1.  To increase capacity from 1 to 2, they must spend (3-2=1) one
day and one thousand Experience.

The storage capacity of the crystal cannot be raised beyond 10, and
the user spends 2 of their FT to store 1 in the crystal, which takes 1
hour. These need not be consecutive.

These points can only be used for paying the FT cost of Spells or Rituals. 

## Crystal Wand of Linking Sense

This crystal wand is 31 cms long, tapering to a five faced point at
the tip, and weighs eleven ounces.  Charges: 1

The wielder adds their MA Bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance. If
their WP is greater than the target, they further increase the Cast
Chance by the difference. If it is lower, then the Cast Chance is
penalised by twice the difference.

Cast Chance: 38%
Range: 105 feet
Duration: Conc. Max. 70 minutes
Resistance: Active & Passive
Target: Living entity

Effects
: The Adept may Trigger this effect by pointing the wand at a target
  within range that they can see and requires but a Fire Action. If
  the target fails to Resist, the Adept may see through the target's
  eyes until the spell ends.

While it is in effect, they may not apply their Agility to their
Defence, nor may they see through their own eyes.

## Crystal Wand of Mental Restoration

This crystal wand is 31 cms long, tapering to a three faced point at
the tip, and weighs eleven ounces.

Charges:
8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1

The wielder adds their MA Bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance. If
their WP is greater than the target, they further increase the Cast
Chance by the difference. If it is lower, then the Cast Chance is
penalised by twice the difference.

Cast Chance: 38%
Range: Touch
Duration: Immediate, during Pulse
Resistance: None
Target: Entity

Effects
: The Adept may Trigger this effect by touching their patient with the
  wand and requires but a Fire Action. The Adept may restore a mental
  stat (MA, WP, PC or FT) by one for every prime value of FT spent,
  thus:

FT spent    Amount restored
--------    ------------------------
    2                1
    3                2
    5                3
    7                4

   13                6
   17                7 

and so on. 

## Stone of Resilience

This dull, faceted stone is grey and opaque, and weighs one lb. 

Charges:
3    2    1

The stone must be carried on the Adept's body, and if it is not then
the magic ends.

It takes three Pass Actions to trigger the stone, after which the
fibres of the Adept's body knit together more elastically for ten
minutes.  While the effect is in place, the Adept Reduces Damage that
crushes by 2.

## Dream Antivenin Amulet

This small, engraved amulet of white jade must be worn over the heart
and next to the skin, so will not be obvious unless the wearer wishes
it. When it is obvious, the wearer's PB increases by 1 to their racial
maximum and reduces the die roll result of any Courtier/Courtesan
Skill Check by 7.

It holds three charges:
3    2    1

If the wearer is subjected to a mental venom, then a charge is drawn
off and they are given a second chance to avoid the effects. If there
is no chance to avoid the venom, then a charge is drawn off to provide
one.

As the charges are used, the amulet changes to colour from white, to
pale green, to dark green and finally to blue.

## Willhammer

This weapon is a cumulative warhammer and military pick, each of which
has a maximum Rank of 5.  It is a one handed weapon, weighs four
pounds, requires PS 15 and MD 13 to wield.  It has a base Strike
Chance of 67%, may be wielded at Range or in Melee, inflicts D10 + 7 A
or C Class damage and has a range of six hexes.  This means that a
roll in the range of either an A or C Class Specific Grievous injury
is legal, but FT damage is assumed to be A Class unless C Class damage
is specified by the wielder.  The maximum bonus from PS is +4.

If the result on the damage die is a prime, then the cumulative Ranks
of this weapon are divided by 4 and the result truncated, their WP
divided by 5 and the result truncated then both are added to the prime
as damage. If it would inflict EN damage, it is, instead, applied to
WP.  This is in addition to the other damage this weapon inflicts.

## Arc Rod

This weapon is a gnarled rod of bark-covered blackthorn about a metre
long. It weighs 11 lbs, even though, by appearance, it would only
weigh 2. Nevertheless, it will still float in water.

It may be wielded as a mace, requiring PS 23 + MD 18 to wield, and has
a base Strike chance of 61%. At a cost of 3 lbs of weight, it will
inflict charged particle damage to a ranged or melee opponent. Targets
take damage depending on their armour, 4D10 if caparisoned in metal,
2D10 otherwise, but bonuses from PS are not applied. If any damage die
generates a 10, then the wielder makes a Strike Check against a target
within 5 feet, preferring those caparisoned in metal (excluding the
wielder), who also take damage accordingly. This process continues
until no tens are generated. No target may receive this attack more
than once per strike.

The rod will recover 3 lbs of weight if it is Purified with and
presented to the sky at dawn on a Thursday.

## Ghost Shield

This large round shield weighs 6 lbs, provides 5 Def per Rank to a
maximum of 25 and penalises MD by 2. For every Rank in excess of 4, it
redirects effects that drain life into a Thirst Pool. The maximum
capacity of the Thirst Pool is 20, and if this is exceeded, all of it
is applied to the wielder, catastrophically.

## Brain Serum x 2

This brass ball is four centimetres across with a screw on cap, and
weighs four ounces. It contains a grey, soupy liquid which, when
taken, cures any injury to the mind or brain, except those that
require complete regeneration taking five minutes.

## Eye Serum

This brass ball is four centimetres across with a screw on cap, and
weighs four ounces. It contains a greenish, soupy liquid which, when
poured into the eye sockets of a single entity, cure blindness from
any cause except those that require complete regeneration taking five
minutes.

## Revification Injection

This hypodermic syrinx is made from surgical brass. It weighs fifteen
oz, the ampoule being twelve cms long by three cms across, with the
syrinx an extra ten cms long. The aperture of the syrinx is five mm
across and is in the shape of a cuboid cylinder with rounded
vertices. Instead of a plunger, a brass gear and crank mechanism is
attached. Some people believe they hear woeful moaning coming from it.

The action of delivery is to drive the syrinx into the breast of the
dead entity, and then to turn the handle, crushing the contents and
forcing them into the target's heart, which will bring them back to
life. The injection must be administered within 24 hours after death
or it does not function at all. Further, for each hour that elapses
after death(minimum one), the patient suffers 1 point of drain from
each Primary Characteristic and Fatigue. This loss can only be
restored by Natural Recovery (one point every three days of rest).

Further, the injection does not heal wounds, neutralize poisons, or
cure diseases, so if proper healing is not administered immediately
(or beforehand), the patient may simply die upon being revivified.

The subject need not be willing and does not normally get any
opportunity to Resist.

## Verminbane Grenado

This grenado weighs 2 lbs, and is made of shards of glass held at the
very moment of fracture.  When it is smashed, three shifting,
discordant tones emanate from it, inflicting 2 rollup D5 non-magical
sonic damage directly to EN over a hemisphere 30 feet across (200
cu. metres or 7,000 cu. ft.).  Prot is not applied, although Damage
Reduction vs Sonics applies.  For every 3 damage taken, a victim
attracts a "disorientation point", requiring a Pass Action to remove,
and no other Action can be taken until they are all gone.

In an enclosed space, the damage increases to 4 rollup D5.

## Antivenin Slime

This test tube weighs 5 oz, and is sealed with a plug of infused
beeswax. It contains a slime that, when swallowed, will spread
throughout the subject's system and remove any synthetic poison that
is less than Rank 5. If the synthetic poison Rank is higher than 4,
then the subject Breaks 100 + EN and if that result is higher than
100 + Rank, then they have successfully thrown the slime, and the
poison, up. While this will take at least thirty seconds, if
successful, no further damage is done.

##  Gossamer of Stolen Dreams

This silken chiffon, spun from the nervous system of a thought eater
and the tendons of thirteen nightgaunts is teal green and can be made
into a diaphonouus shoulder cape or shawl. It weighs eleven ounces and
has no special properties if it is worn over plate, chain, scale mail
or any kind of metalic armour. And it would look odd in a bad way.

If it is worn over soft leather armour or similar, it extends somewhat
into the Astral, and so will provide five more points of Protection
(to a maximum of thirteen), eight points of Spell Armour, and one
point of Damage Reduction, which applies to everything except the
special damage of Specific Grievous injuries and poisons.

In addition, the wearer can feel through the the shawl, so it provides
one point of Defence for every three points of Agility. However,
although it protects against damage, it is entirely transparent to
pain. If they receive a blow that inflicts ten points of damage, then
they will take five fewer points because of the shawl, but they may be
Stunned if the full amount is greater than one third of their modified
EN value.

For the purposes of determining how long it will take to repair, the
shawl has ten EN which it recovers at a rate of one point every three
days. If an attempt is made to heal it, this will destroy the
nightgaunt tendons, freeing the thought eater, which will be very
hungry.

It will require the arts of a Rank 4 Seamstress or Tailor to make the
shawl, and they will charge 50 truesilver guineas for their work.

## The Two-Faced Blade

This broadsword has a long, slightly curved blade, etched on either side with glyphs:

מעמקי קברים ונוגה נר
and
אני חורט מסכת מוות מר

It is made from infernal gravesteel, is always darker than the
surrounding light level and it weighs nine pounds.

At the centre of the quillons, a funeral mask is carved onto a bronze
disk, its expression varying on examination from despair to glee. The
pommel stone is a cairngorm the size of a hen's egg, which glows
sombrely.

A PS of 27 and MD of 15 is required to wield this weapon. The base
Strike Chance is 67% and it inflicts 2 D10! + 11 B Class damage. Twos
rolled on the damage dice are read as sevens. The only weapon spell it
accepts is Spectral Weapon and it does not provide bonuses for damage
because of excess PS. It does provide damage bonuses for every four
Ranks in Broadsword, only.

If the inscriptions are deciphered, then more of its functions may be
revealed.

## Sard Vial of Healing

This vial is made of banded sardonyx and is the length and thickness
of a blacksmith's thumb. It weighs fourteen ounces at the moment and
seven ounces when empty..

The vial has five more charges.

Currently, the contents of the vial will cure seven points of damage
in the following order of precedence: Specific Grievous injuries >> EN
damage >> FT damage. The entire dose must be taken for it to take
effect, any excess healing is lost.

To empower the vial, an Alchemist must draw their own blood,
concentrate it, titrate it and decant it therein. The first point of
healing costs 1 EN, the next costs 2 EN, the third costing 3 EN, and
so on. This EN loss may only be recovered by natural healing. The
weight (less 7 ounces) indicates how many points it heals.

## Clarity

Three Sanity may be converted to one Clarity during Purification which
may be spent as a Free Action to make sense of gathered information.
It cannot be used to collect information, per se, but provides an
opportunity to make sense of information that is confusing or to
winnow out deceptions.

As a Free Act, Callas may elect to penetrate an Illusion by spending
Clarity with her Enhanced Vision Talent, and, if successful, see the
underlying reality.

She may also cure mental illnesses, diseases, wounds or injuries by
adding Clarity to an attempt to Heal according to, but not limited to,
the following schedule:

Rk    Effect

## Ear Serum x 2

This brass ball is four centimetres across with a screw on cap, and
weighs four ounces. It contains a bluish, soupy liquid which, when
poured into the ear of a single entity, cures deafness from any cause
except those that require complete regeneration, and only taking five
minutes.

## Eyestalk Harness

This cuir-bouilli gorget is studded with bronze rivets and weighs 1 lb
and 9 oz. It increases the wearer's Defence by 3, and in the event
that Specific Grievous Injury result is 68 or 69, then 2 is added to
the D10 result to determine the location of the wound. A result of 11
or 12 indicates that the Specific Grievous Injury has missed
completely and no damage is inflicted.

At a cost of 1 FT, the wearer may extend one or more of their eyes (to
a maximum of 5) on stalks that extend as far as 50 cms for twelve
Pulses.  In the event that the wearer receives a Specific Grievous
Injury that results in an amputation, then an eye is lost.

## Animated Exoskeleton

This device is eighteen inches tall, made from curved tiles of dark
green laen connected by rods of orichalcum, and will fit a
brownie. The wearer must sacrifice 1 EN to bind the exoskeleton to
themselves, whereupon it will raise the wearer's

* PS to the next prime
* AG to the next prime
* non-flight TMR to the next prime
* Defence to the next prime
* NA to the next prime

It will also convert the wearer's Natural Armour to Damage
Reduction. This will not apply to poison, disease, Disruption,
Necrosis, Putrid Wound or similar effects

## The Horse Shoes of Ishkur

These shoes are made from the bones of nephilim. Typically, only four
of them may be worn at one time, and although they can be swapped out,
the magic of new ones take a week before they start working. When a
shoe is removed, it immediately stops working.

## Shoe of the Horn

Grants the ability to project a yard long illusory horn of shadows; 
The mount can:
- make a Presence attack with a base bonus of 15% and cause Fear
- dispel an illusion by touch once per day.

## Shoe of Robust Health
Improves reslience and resistance to disase
- +10 to Resist Disease
-  multiplies the amount of EN recovered from Natural Healing by 5

## Shoe of the Transformation
Improves the duration of a shape change

- multiplies the duration of a shape change by 12
-  provides one extra shape change per day

## Shoe of the Dark Flames

Leaves a trail of hoof prints that burn with dark flames where the mount has passed

- once a day, the mount (and rider) become shadowy and return to where
  it started in the previous Pulse so long as they traveled overland
  and by their own means.

## Shoe of the Thunderer

Increases the amount of damage of any kick or trample by 1 D10 and all are rollup dice.

- once per day, the mount can deliver a Charge attack that is
  perpendicular to their facing. This allows the mount to attack every
  1 hex (or less) creature in every hex that it passes through up to
  its full TMR, and this is considered a Trample.

- after rearing, the mount can deliver an attack to every creature in
  their front facing hexes. Unless their opponent is a multi-hex
  creature, this is resolved as an attack rated for Close but carries
  a 20 point penalty to Strike Chance.

## Shoe of the Herd

Creates multiple images of the mount and rider. This can only be used
once a week, and resets on a Friday at dawn. Either

- create six other illusory copies of the mount (and rider) which will
  never travel further than five hexes from the mount

or


- create a single illusory copy of the mount (and rider) which can be
  directed to travel up to seven leagues away. It cannot fight or
  perform magic but it can speak simple messages.

## Shoe of Nightfall

This shoe can only be used once a month, resetting on the third night
of the Dark of the Moon.

- call night from horizon to horizon, taking half an hour

## Proscenium Wand

Range
: 120 feet

Duraction
: Concentration max. 10 minutes

Cast Chance
: 40%

This crystal wand is 17 inches long and streams with rainbow colours
when it is being used. The wielder adds their MA over 15, WP over 15,
half their Rank in Troubadour and Enchantment to the base Cast Chance.

It holds three charges.
3    2    1

Discharging a charge creates a visible phenomenon that is no larger
than 20 feet by 20 feet by 10 feet, and any dimension less that five
feet is considered to be five feet.

The image appears at a visible spot within range and lasts for as long
as concentration is maintained, or ten minutes, whichever is
least. The scene will seem real and include appropriate sounds,
smells, and temperature. Damage can't be created with this magic, but
it can be used to create visual impairments, distracting sounds and
distressing smells as if the magic were Rank 10. (Smoke Creation,
Create Fog, Noxious Vapours, Ethereal Orchestra, Audile Illusions.)

Creatures or objects in the area of effect can be moved or modified to
reflect behaviour. For example, a creature could be made to appear to
walk or talk, although the area of effect cannot be moved. Physical
interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
things can pass through it. If a creature discerns the illusion for
what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other
sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

If the wielder Purifies with the wand in the hour before true Dawn,
then they roll a D10. If the result is a prime, then a charge is
restored.

## Copper Nails x 6

If this copper nail is driven into the foot print of a witch, Wiccan
or hag, then they will lose 1 TMR. They will also leave bleeding
footprints unless they take time to bandage their feet.

## Sedan Chair

This sedan chair is fully enclosed with silken curtains, is eight feet
long, two yards wide and five feet high. It will fold down into a
cylinder of enchanted wood and silk one yard long and six inches
across. It is large enough to seat 19 sizes of humanoids, yet only
weighs 25 lbs. It provides 8 Protection and 20 Defence to passengers
with respect to physical attacks from below.

A small, pintle-mounted ballista is placed at the right hand rear
corner of the chair, which fires javelins as if they were Heavy
Crossbow quarrels, inflicting 2 rollup D10 + 5 A Class missile
damage. There is no PS requirement to wield the ballista, but it takes
five Pass Actions to reload it, less 1 for every five points of PS in
excess of 20, minimum 1.

It is a legal target for the Instilling Flight spell, but with these
distinctions:
* the duration of the spell is 30 minutes (+30 minutes per Rank)
* if the Adept travels in excess of their TMR, then their Magic
  Resistance and Defence is reduced to zero (+25 for flying and
  movement).
* they may slow down from or speed up to the maximum speed so long as
  they maintain at least one hex of movement per Pulse.


## Trident of Frost and Mist

The tines of this trident were made from the tooth of a sea serpent
from the frozen north, set into golden brown larch wood.It has a faint
scent of grapefruit when it is warm or held for a time.

The base Strike Chance is 53%, requires PS 13 and MD 17 and may be
wielded one- or two-handed. It weighs 3 lbs, and inflicts damage
according to its prime, thus:

Result	Damage
---		---
1		2
2		3
3		5
4		7
5		11
6		13
7		17
8		19
9		23
10		29

To this is added 4, plus any bonuses for excess PS (to a maximum of
+4), bonuses for Rank and bonuses to Strike Chance and damage from the
Weapon of Cold spell (only). In the event of a Strike Check that is 5%
or less and a Possible Specific Grievous injury result that is greater
than 20, then another Possible Specific Grievous injury is rolled. If
this is also greater than 20, then a final roll is allowed.


If a spell of Ray of Cold is ritually cast into the trident, which
will require the Adept seethe ambergris in walrus milk, then it will
be stored therein. This process will cost as much as if the spell were
Invested into a scroll. The trident can hold eight charges of this
spell. The user adds their MA bonus, any Aspect bonus and Enchantment
to the Cast Chance, not the investors.

When the spell is released, requiring a Fire Action, the user may
spend two charges and cast the spell over a conical volume of effect
that it is 15 feet long (+15 for every two Ranks) and 5 feet wide (+5
feet per Rank)

The trident can hold eight charges.
8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1 

If a spell of Gaseous Form is ritually cast into the trident, which
will require the Adept add natrium to lamprey oil and stand well
clear, then it will be stored therein. This process will cost as much
as if the spell were Invested into a scroll.  The trident can hold
three charges of this spell.  The user adds their MA bonus, any Aspect
bonus and Enchantment to the Cast Chance, not the investors.

3 2 1

Both processes are noisome, and require a laboratorium that is remote
from decent folk, lest they take up arms for the remedy.
