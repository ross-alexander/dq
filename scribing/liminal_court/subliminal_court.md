# Items

## Vermilion Fan of the Orient

This pleated fan has black, pointed spines that are 23 cms long,
linked to 13 red jade panels and weighs 13 oz. It is a spell rack.

It may be wielded as a buckler, and, as a Reflex Action, it may be
used to increase the wielder's Defence by their MD until their next
Action in the next Pulse.  Once used, it cannot be used for 4 Pulses.


## Spirit Net of the Necromanteion

This small net-like decoration is about 15 cms long and 4 cms wide. It
is made from the dessicated sinews of a priestess of the Black Land
and although it only weighs 4 oz, it encumbers as if it weighed 1
lb. It is a spell rack.

It must be worn on the chest, either as a cloak pin for the left lapel
or brooch on the upper left torso for it to be effective.  The first
Healing spell the wearer receives in a day is enhanced to cure 3
damage points in addition to any other granted. This does not apply to
healing from potions, draughts or the Arts of Healers and Herbalists.

## Bracelet of Luck

This bracelet is made of seven empty, oblong, bronze plates the size
of a Hobbit's smallest finger and twice as wide which are connected by
bronze links. It must be worn on the left wrist for its magic to be
effective.

The wearer may increase their Cast Chance with spell magic by the
value of their Luck stat.

Each setting will hold a rectangular stone, but all must be different
and at least semi-precious. When all the settings are filled, it will
be a spell rack.

## The Windswept Cloak

This Ulster Cloak reaches to the knee, has a high collar and an
overmantle that covers the shoulders down to the middle of the
back. It is lined with the feathers of rooks, and although it looks
like a heavy leather cloak, it weighs only 11 oz.

It is Air Aspected, and allows the wearer to reduce their flying speed
to as little as 3 Hexes per Pulse before stalling and beginning to
fall, if they are flying by means of wings.

If the wearer is also Aspected for Air, then they may advance the
Aerial Affinity Talent. If the cloak is subsequently lost, no further
advancement is possible but they keep the Ranks they have learnt.

## Thinga - It's pronounced 'Tina'

Thinga is a revenant who is possessing the metre-long right forelimb
of a tyrannosaur. This has three talons, one of which is opposable.
When it is the target of a spell of Animating Bodily Parts, Thinga
manifests as an indistinct but clearly feminine spectral form attached
to this forelimb but can only interact with the material world through
that arm.

* PS is 20 (+2 × the Rank of the spell)
* MD is 10
* MA is 3
* WP is 13
* Combined EN & FT is 10 (+2 × the Rank of the spell)

* if she takes more damage than this, she will be forced to abandon
  the forelimb for the Underworld, and may not return until a Rite of
  Calling is performed on a night of the Dark of the Moon.

* All her other stats are 0.

While manifest:

* Slaydar increases the Cast Chance of his magic by his MD if the
range is Touch or if the word Hand appears in its name may see the
spirits of the dead, restless or otherwise, but not totem spirits. The
range is 50 feet (+10 feet per Rank of the Animating Bodily Parts
spell). It does not penetrate visual and physical obscurements and
cannot see into or on Consecrated ground

* Thinga will not travel far from Slaydar except under the most dire
of circumstances, whereupon she loses her spectral form, her TMR is 2
and her movement rate is 20 yards per minute once a Pulse, if she is
adjacent to Slaydar, may deliver an Unarmed Combat attack either in
Melee or Close using Slaydar's Rank (but her own stats), in addition
to any of Slaydar's Actions. The base damage is one rollup D10, may
deliver B or C Class Specific Grievous injuries, but no amputations
unless it might remove a hand.

* Thinga is an adolescent female of a race closely related to orcs, if
  not precisely one. She is working on developing two more fingers,
  particularly the middle one, which, given her personlity, she
  expects to get the most use out of. Each fingers will raise her MD
  by 4.

* Thinga has a way of standing to indicate that she is rolling her
  eyes. This is a racial talent.


## Enchanted Gems 

The se gems are legal targets of the Ritual of Enchantment and last
until the end of the season. Each Ritual costs 1 oz black myrrh and 1
oz of white sandalwood which will cost 300 sp (sandalwood trees take
around three decades to mature and are scarce).

### Eye of the Snow Tiger

This milky white stone is lenticular and about 1 cm wide. It has an
amber stripe about 2 mms wide. Once set into a bezel, Enchanted and
worn on the wrist, it adds 1 to MR and 2 to Def which stacks with any
Amulet of Luck and reduces the count of the number of Amulets of Luck
by 1.

### Jade Disc

This 1 cm wide, disc-shaped green jade, once set into a bezel,
Enchanted and worn on the wrist, increases the wearer's Initiative by
8 and allows any Cast or Strike check vs the undead that ends in an 8
to be treated as ending with a 1 and any damage roll of 1 on a D10
becomes 8.
 
### Jacinth Lozenge

This 1 cm, lozenge-shaped dark blue jacinth, once set in a bezel,
Enchanted and worn on the wrist, adds 2 to the wearer’s MD. This bonus
only applies to the hand on the wrist where the gem is worn. If a
shield is used on that hand, the gem reduces the MD penalty, only, but
means that the shield is not destroyed unless it is cloven against two
Specific Grievous injuries to preserve the wearer's armour.


## T-Rex Leather Armour

Wgt
: 18 lbs

Prot
: 8

AG Mod

Stealth Mod

# Abilities

## Sin's Wraithcloak

Sin's Wraithcloak Spell has been modified by an ancient Moon God so
that it protects against damage from silvered weapons in addition to
mundane weapons.

## Knap of the Earth

Slaydar has learnt a high speed Flying Manoeuvre that lets him fly at
25 feet above the ground - 1 per Rank in Flying.  It applies only to
methods of flight that involve wings or similar.

Their chance to perform this manoeuvre is 3 × AG + 12 × Rank.  A
penalty of thirty is applied to their Flying Skill in addition to
their speed in miles per hour, less one for every foot above the
ground. It assumes that they are travelling at full speed or faster as
a consequence of diving and, hopefully, pulling out before making
contact with the ground.  Speeds in excess of that granted by the
method of flight bleed off each Pulse.  However, at such speeds,
control is compromised and speed can only be reduced by half the
excess speed each Pulse or their Rank in mph, whichever is greater.

> Example: Slaydar has Rank 3 with the Flying Skill and is diving on
> Rank 10 Shadow Wings.  His speed has climbed to 70 mph, 30 mph
> faster than the wings can normally travel.  After pulling out of the
> dive, Slaydar can slow his speed by half the excess (15 mph) down to
> 55 mph, then half that (7 mph) down to 47 mph, then half that (3
> mph) to 43 mph, and finally down to the Shadow Wing's standard
> flight speed.

This only applies to the Knap of the Earth manoeuvre, and assumes he
is spending his attention on avoiding obstacles and terrain features.
An ability to decelerate to a stop in a second or two requires a high
deceleration Flight Manoeuvre.  Which is not this one.

# Incantations

## Enchiridion of Bolt of Energy

This small, A5 sized booklet is made from cream coloured vellum bound
with brass rings and weighs 11 oz. It contains instructions which will
teach the Bolt of Energy spell, and incantations of the Bolt of Energy
spell.  Once an incantation is learnt, the ink will fade leaving a
blank page.

It is a Spell Rack for Incantations of the Bolt of Energy spell, and
is advanced separately.

## Bolt of Energy - Levin Bolt
Resist
: Passive, for half damage

Effects
: A bolt of lightning about the length and shape of a javelin flies
  from the Adept's outstretched hand, damaging the first object or
  entity that it impacts for 1 rollup D10 (+1 per Rank) and are Dazed
  unless they Resist, in which case they take half damage.  Dazed
  victims can take no other Action except a Pass Action to recover.

Cost
: 1000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 1

## Bolt of Energy - Lightning Bolt

Range
: 60 feet

Resist
: Active, Passive

Target
: Entity, Object

Effects
: A single bolt of lightning 60 feet long flies from the Adept's
  fingertips.  The bolt must extend the entire 60 feet and will
  deflect off stone until it reaches its full extent.  All targets
  that are in the path of the bolt must resist or suffer [D + 5] (+ 1
  / 3 Ranks) damage (save for half damage).

In addition, any target who fails to resist is automatically stunned.

Cost
: 2500 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 2

## Bolt of Energy - Bolt of Fire

Range
: 25 feet (+25 feet per Rank)

Resist
: Passive

Effects
: A bolt of fire flies from the Adept's outstretched hand, damaging
  the first object or entity that it impacts for 1 rollup D10 (+1 per
  Rank) of magical fire damage unless they Resist.  If flammable, the
  target's clothing will ignite 70% of the time if they did not
  Resist.

Cost
: 1000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 1 

## Bolt of Energy - Ray of Cold

Resist
: Passive

Effects
: This incantation of the spell projects a blast of intense magical
  cold at the target. The ray of cold will impact either on the target
  or on the first obstruction blocking the path from the Adept to the
  target.  Anything struck by the ray must either resist or suffer D10
  (+ 1 / Rank) cold damage (resist for half).

Cost
: 1000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 1

## Bolt of Energy - Razor Orb

Resist
: None

Effects
: If the Cast is successful, the Adept imbues a mass of tangled glass
  wire about 10 cms across with sufficient energy to fly at at a
  target and inflict B Class damage.  The glass wire will require the
  services of a Rank 8+ artisan glass blower who is also an abstract
  stained glass glazier. They will charge 10 tsg for each mass of
  glass wire and can only produce one every three days.

The chance to hit is the same as the Cast Chance less the target's
Defence and Missile Range penalties.  However, the Razor Orb inflicts
damage directly to EN on 20% or less of the modified Strike Chance,
and a Possible Specific Grievous injury on 10%.  Damage is calculated
at 1 rollup D10 (+1 rollup D10 for every ten Ranks) (+1 B Class Damage
per Rank). Enhancing damage will increase the number of rollup D10s
AND the damage per Rank.

Damage is affected by the Protection value of armour and Damage
Reduction, if appropriate.

Cost
: 3000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, requires a mass of glass wire, reduces FT value by 2

## Bolt of Energy - Burst of Energy

Resist
: None

Range
: Self

Target
: Sentient Entity

Effects
: The Adept may recover an amount of lost FT equal to the total number
  of non-Prime Ranks in the spell and it does not cost FT to Cast.

The Adept may only benefit from this incantation once per dawn, unless
a duplicate is known.

Cost
: 3000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell 

## Bolt of Energy - Orb of Flight

Range
: Self

Duration
: 20 minutes (+20 minutes per Rank)

Target
: Sentient Entity

Effects
: The Adept transforms into a reflective yellow orb about 30 cms
  across. In this form, they may move in three dimensions at their TMR
  (+1 per five full Ranks).  Upon climbing to a height of 15 metres or
  more, they may accelerate up to a movement rate of 30 miles per hour
  (+1 mph per Rank), directing their travel by means of a Torrent of
  Energy.  While the orb does not shed light, it is extremely
  eye-catching even in regions of low light, unless Invisible or
  Unseen.

As an orb, the Adept's base Defence is improved by 20 because of their
small size, but they do not benefit from a shield or main-gauche. They
may Evade, but gain no benefit from weapon Ranks.

They have no EN, PS, MD or PB in this form. They keep their AG, MA, WP
and FT values. Once FT is exhausted, they are forced back to their
normal form, whereupon they, routinely, plummet.

They may Prepare or Cast Spells and Rituals, use Talents, speak or
understand a language, sing or use any Skill that does not require a
physical form.

Cost
: 2500 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 2

## Ancient Cantrip Gift of Moon-bright Silver

Range
: Touch

Duration
: MA minutes

Effects
: The Adept covers a single object in moon-bright silver for the
  duration of the cantrip. Were-creatures and lycanthropes who are
  damaged by this silver do not benefit from racial Damage Reduction
  and protections.

## Bolt of Starfire - Torrent of Radiance

Range
: 1 hex (+ 1 hex for every 10 Ranks)

Duration
: Immediate (during Pulse)

Target
: Volume of Effect

Effects
: The Adept Casts a devastating cascade that effects the three hexes
  in front of them. This extends a hex further for every 10 Ranks. Any
  entity or object caught in the volume of efect must Resist or suffer
  1 rollup D10 (+1 Radiant damage per Rank) (+1 rollup D10 for every
  ten Ranks).

For the total count of non-prime numbers less than or equal to the
damage inflicted, targets are thrown away from the Adept as many feet,
and must Break 100, adding their Agility to the result, or fall Prone.

E.g., if the spell inflicts 23 damage then targets will be thrown 14
feet further away from the Adept, since 22 is the 14th non-prime.

1    4    6    8    9    10   12   14   15    16  18   20   21   22   24   25   26 
---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---
1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17

27   28   30   32   33   34   35   36   38   39   40   42   44   45   46
---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---
18   19   20   21   22   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   31   32   33

Because the damage is Radiant in nature, undead must roll under half
their Magic Resistance to escape its effects.

Additionally, if the Cast Check falls in the range of a Double Effect,
the Rank of the spell is increased by five. If it falls in the range
of a Triple Effect, then the Rank is increased by fifteen.

Cost
: 2500 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 2

: Self

in Melee or Close. If two of these three attacks are successful, then
a free Rake attack is allowed.

The maximum Rank of each attack is determined by the Rank of the spell:

-----   ------  ------------------- --------  ---- -----------------------------------------
Bite    SC 45         DM +7         A Class   MC   Max Rk: Rank / 4
Claw    SC 50         DM +5         B Class   MC   Max Rk: Rank / 3, 7 @ Rk 19, 8 @ Rk 20

-----   ------  ------------------- --------  ---- -----------------------------------------

the Reckoning as if it were Weapon Ranking, although it counts as
Magic Training.

### The Bite: Specific Grievous Injury Table

01 – 05
: Congratulations! It’s a bleeder in your primary arm! Take 1 Damage
  Point from Endurance immediately and 1 per pulse thereafter until
  the flow is staunched by a Healer of Rank 0 or above or you die.

06 – 07
: Oh no! Your opponent’s weapon has entered your secondary arm’s elbow
  joint. Take 2 Damage Points immediately from Endurance and that arm
  is useless until the sliver has been treated by a Healer of Rank 3
  or above. Also, increase the chance of infection by 30.

08 - 12
: You have been stabbed in your secondary arm. Drop whatever you were
  holding in it and take 2 Damage Points immediately from
  Endurance. It will take a full week for the arm to be of any use to
  you whatsoever.

13
: Your opponent’s weapon has entered your eye. Roll D10. On a roll of
  1, the weapon has entered your brain and you are dead. On a roll of
  2–5, your left eye is blinded. On a roll of 6–10, your right eye is
  blinded. If you are lucky enough to be blinded instead of killed,
  you have suffered 2 Damage Points to Endurance.  In addition, a
  figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
  -1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. A figure blinded in one
  eye reduces their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by
  30.

14 – 18
: Tsk, tsk. A wound of the solid viscera. Usually fatal. Take 3 Damage
  Points to Endurance immediately and 1 per pulse thereafter until the
  bleeding is stopped by a Healer of Rank 2 or above or you die. Add
  30 to the chance of infection.

19 – 20
: Take a stab in the leg (your choice as to which one) resulting in a
  deep puncture of the thigh muscle. Suffer 1 Damage Point to
  Endurance immediately and reduce your TMR by 1 until you heal, which
  will take 4 weeks.

21 – 24
: A nasty puncture in the region of the shoulder and neck. Your
  secondary collar bone is crushed. Drop anything held in that hand
  and take 4 Damage Points to Endurance.

25 – 27
: A nasty puncture in the region of the shoulder and neck. Your
  primary collar bone is crushed. Drop anything held in that hand and
  take 4 Damage Points to Endurance.

28 – 30
: Long fangs have punctured your skull inflicting 7 Damage Points to
  Endurance. This can only be Healed naturally (1 point of EN every
  three days), unless the Healer can Repair Vital Organs or
  Regenerate.

: A chest wound. Take 2 Damage Points to Endurance immediately and
  reduce your TMR by 1 until recovered (about 2 months).

26 – 28
: Bad luck! Your secondary hand has been severed at the wrist. Take 2
  Damage Points immediately from Endurance and 1 point per pulse from
  Fatigue thereafter (Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) until you
  are dead or the bleeding is staunched by a Healer of Rank 0 or
  above. If you live, reduce your MD by 2.

29 – 31
: Worst luck! Your primary hand has been severed. See result 26–27 for
  effects.

33 – 35
: Your secondary arm is sliced off at the shoulder. Take 5 Damage
  Points immediately from Endurance and 1 per pulse thereafter from

  your MD by 2 and your AG by 1.

  by 2 and your AG by 1.

37 – 42
: You have been eviscerated! Take 4 Damage Points immediately from
  Endurance and 1 point per pulse from Fatigue thereafter (Endurance
  when Fatigue is exhausted) until you are unconscious. Increase your
  chance of infection by 40.

43 – 48
: A slash along one arm, and it’s a bleeder! Take 2 Damage Points
  immediately from Endurance and lose 1 point from Fatigue (Endurance
  when Fatigue is exhausted) each pulse until the bleeding is stopped
  by a Healer of Rank 1 or above or you die.

51 – 52
: Hamstrung! Roll D10. On a roll of 1–4, it is your left leg. On a
  roll of 5–10 it is your right. Take 4 Damage Points immediately from
  Endurance and fall prone. You may not stand unassisted until the
  wound is healed (which should take three months). Reduce your AG by
  3 permanently.

53 – 60
: Your primary arm is crippled by a wicked slash! Take 2 damage Points
  immediately to Endurance and drop anything you have in your primary
  hand. The arm is unusable until healed, which should take 2 months.

  roll of 1–3, your head is severed and your corpse tumbles to the
  ground. On a roll of 4–6, your secondary collar bone is crushed; on
  a roll of 7–10 your primary collar bone is crushed. If your collar
  bone is crushed, the results are identical to 53–60, except you
  suffer 4 Damage Points to Endurance.

70 – 74

  Endurance and suffer a reduction of 4 in both PS and MD lasting for
  3 days.

used a hex. Movement up or down is at a 45 degree angle, and uses one
hex up for every horizontal hex. When the reserve is used up, the
entire path dissipates. If it hasn't dissipated, it will fade away
when the sun rises.
