# Items

## Spirit Net of the Necromanteion

This small net-like decoration is about 15 cms long and 4 cms wide. It
is made from the dessicated sinews of a priestess of the Black Land
and although it only weighs 4 oz, it encumbers as if it weighed 1
lb. It is a spell rack.

It must be worn on the chest, either as a cloak pin for the left lapel
or brooch on the upper left torso for it to be effective.  The first
Healing spell the wearer receives in a day is enhanced to cure 3
damage points in addition to any other granted. This does not apply to
healing from potions, draughts or the Arts of Healers and Herbalists.

## Bracelet of Luck

This bracelet is made of seven empty, oblong, bronze plates the size
of a Hobbit's smallest finger and twice as wide which are connected by
bronze links. It must be worn on the left wrist for its magic to be
effective.

The wearer may increase their Cast Chance with spell magic by the
value of their Luck stat.

Each setting will hold a rectangular stone, but all must be different
and at least semi-precious. When all the settings are filled, it will
be a spell rack.

## The Windswept Cloak

This Ulster Cloak reaches to the knee, has a high collar and an
overmantle that covers the shoulders down to the middle of the
back. It is lined with the feathers of rooks, and although it looks
like a heavy leather cloak, it weighs only 11 oz.

It is Air Aspected, and allows the wearer to reduce their flying speed
to as little as 3 Hexes per Pulse before stalling and beginning to
fall, if they are flying by means of wings.

If the wearer is also Aspected for Air, then they may advance the
Aerial Affinity Talent. If the cloak is subsequently lost, no further
advancement is possible but they keep the Ranks they have learnt.
