# Items

## The Archaeological Axe

This hand axe is a one-handed weapon, the haft of which is made from
woven lianas that have been steeped in Shadow Wine and dried so that
it knows only the touch of darkness or moonlight.

If the haft has been exposed to the light of six different Full Moons,
terminating by the Autumnal Equinox, then it will be strong and
resilient.  In particular, it will not break unless the wielder's PS
value is greater than 38.  The head is made of black bronze, will hold
an edge indefinitely and the entire weapon weighs but two lbs.

It requires a PS of 8 and MD of 11 to wield, and inflicts D10 + 1 B
Class damage.  The base Strike Chance is 61 and it is Ranked as a Hand
Axe, although it is not balanced for throwing.

The bearer may Detect Secret or Hidden Apertures, Detect Traps and
Remove them as if their Rank in Thief was the same as their Rank in
Hand Axe.  Similarly, they increase their Resistance against Minor or
Major Curses by their Rank in this weapon.  In the event they are the
target of a Death Curse, a result equal to or less than their Rank,
means they have Resisted it.


## Psychedelic Waterpipe of Ninevah

This oriental waterpipe is made from orichalcum, and it is the only
known way to consume Dust of Ages safely.  For certain values of
safety.

Dust of ages is placed in the fuming chamber, and mixed with
Assassin's oil in roughly equal values.  Then, the chamber is closed
and coals laid over it so that the mixture takes light.

The fumes should be breathed in over the ensuing 15 minutes, and if
successful (30 or less on %iles), the smoker will be taken back to a
time of their preference that is within 3 × their lifespan.  They may
only see what has taken place where they are, no movement or remote
viewing is possible.  Failure indicates that they spend half an hour
in pleasant dreams of the distant past.

## Bullets of Vril Crystal × 9

These crystal cylinders are 1 & 1/6th of an inch long and 2/5ths of an
inch in diameter.  Each weighs 2/7ths of an oz.  They may be fired
from a Walther P8 semi-automatic pistol.

The bullet may be charged with up to four points of Vril, at a cost of
2 FT for each Vril, and will begin to shed faint blue light.  If the
bullet hits, the crystal shatters inflicting 1 D10 A Class damage,
against which Protection applies.  The impact will destroy it,
releasing the payload.  For every point of Vril the bullet has been
charged by, base Astral damage of 2 is inflicted, which is reduced by
Spell Armour.  A D10 is rolled for every 2 points of Astral damage,
and a number returned according to the following schedule:

A roll of 
- 1 results in a Power of 1.
- 2 or 3 results in a Power of 2.
- 4, 5 or 6 results in a Power of 3.
- 7, 8, 9 or 10 results in a Power of 4.

This is the value that the base Astral damage is raised to. 

## Walther P8
This semi-automatic pistol is made of aluminium and non-ferrous
metal. It weighs 2 lbs, 4 & 1/8th oz. It uses 9x19 Parabellum
ammunition, and it can hold 8 rounds.

The PS requirement to wield this weapon is 12 and the MD requirement
is 18. It has a base Strike Chance of 40%, and a maximum Rank
of 5. When the wielder has advanced to Rank 3, they may shoot twice in
the Pulse, and at Rank 5, three times.

## Illithid Ichor × 6

These phials are as long a spinster's middle finger and as wide.  They
contain a black and grey soupy fluid.  They do not appear to weigh
anything, but whoever carries one feels depressed and sad, losing 1
point of WP per phial.  When unencumbered of the phials, WP recovers
at a rate of 1 every 3 days.

## Illithid Hearts

- 3 Dark
- 4 Cold
- 2 Malice

## Stovepipe Hat and Lenses

This stovepipe hat is made from particularly hardy dark green felt,
with a navy blue leather ribbon to which are attached a pair of
lenses. It weighs 11 oz.

If it is worn by a Mechanician with the Hydro-mechanics specialty,
then they will also know how to maintain and run steam engines.  If
they have the Metalworking specialty, they may build them.

When the lenses are worn, they allow the wearer to make out heat
sources, even through mist or steam, as if they had Infravision to a
range of 12 hexes.  The lenses cause some strain to use, so that after
12 Pulses, the wearer loses one FT to tiredness.

## Liquor of Elemental Bronze

This test tube is 5 cms long and 1 cm wide, weighing an oz. The
contents are a dull bronze colour which behaves like mercury.

It must be sublimated and passed into an active chakram, whereupon it
will convert the bone at that site to elemental bronze without causing
any harm.

## Tincture of the Epicure's Vapours

This test tube is 5 cms long and 1 cm wide, weighing an oz. The
contents are a thick, roiling cloud of teal and red.

It must be sublimated and passed into an active throat chakram,
whereupon the consumer will be able to extend their sense of taste up
to a metre distant.

## Decoction of the Iris of Kenos

This test tube is 5 cms long and 1 cm wide, weighing an oz. It
contains a faint, violet glow.

It must be sublimated and passed into an active third eye chakram,
whereupon the eye may be opened to peer upon the Void.

## Cuneiform Keys and the Ring of Aglarond

This set of six keys are made from orichalcum.  They are bound to the
Ring of Aglarond, a thick ring made of an alloy of gold and mithril
the colour of sunlight reflected off ice.  It will shine flaxen if the
restless dead are within 15 hexes.  The ring is 10 cms in diameter,
and is a cm thick. The ring and keys weigh 2 lbs 7 oz and penalise
Stealth by 15.

A key may be bound to a gate or portal so that it may be locked or
unlocked by writing the connected locations on the bitting in
cuneiform.  This is permanent and cannot be changed subsequently.

While it is locked, the gate or portal cannot be used unless the key
is presented and used, which will take 4 Pass Actions.

## The Tripartite Spear

This black wooden rod is a 90 cms long and weighs 2 lbs 5 oz and looks
like a cane with a blue glass ferrule.  It can be separated into three
30 cm sections, whereupon the ferrule will form a leaf-shaped blade.
The length from the tip of the blade to the butt is 2 metres, although
it can only be held by the sections of black wood. It may be wielded
one or two handed.

It requires a PS of 13 and an MD of 15 to wield, inflicts D10+3 A
Class damage by default, although, if specified, the wielder may
strike with the butt to inflict C Class damage. The base Strike Chance
is 57%. If it is wielded one-handed in their right, the base Strike
Chance rises to 67%.

It is advanced as a spear, although it cannot be thrown and damage
increases by 1 on each Rank that is a Prime (2, 3 & 5). Damage from PS
in excess of 13 is ignored, although it will accept weapon spells it
is a legal target for.  It is considered a sword with respect to
Celestial weapon spells.


## Revification Injection

This hypodermic syrinx is made from surgical brass. It weighs fifteen
oz, the ampoule being twelve cms long by three cms across, with the
syrinx an extra ten cms long. The aperture of the syrinx is five mm
across and is in the shape of a cuboid cylinder with rounded vertices.
Instead of a plunger, a brass gear and crank mechanism is attached.
Some people believe they hear woeful moaning coming from it.

The action of delivery is to drive the syrinx into the breast of the
dead entity, and then to turn the handle, crushing the contents and
forcing them into the target’s heart, which will bring them back to
life. The injection must be administered within 24 hours after death
or it does not function at all. Further, for each hour that elapses
after death(minimum one), the patient suffers 1 point of drain from
each Primary Characteristic and Fatigue.  This loss can only be
restored by Natural Recovery (one point every three days of rest).

Further, the injection does not heal wounds, neutralize poisons, or
cure diseases, so if proper healing is not administered immediately
(or beforehand), the patient may simply die upon being revivified.

The subject need not be willing and does not normally get any
opportunity to Resist.

## Julska Kriza

This small pistol weighs 1 lb 5 oz. The PS requirement to wield this
weapon is 8 and the MD requirement is 18.  It has a base Strike Chance
of 40%, has a maximum Rank of 5.  When the wielder has advanced to
Rank 3, they may shoot twice in the Pulse, and at Rank 5, three times.

If the wielder rolls greater than 70+MD, then they miss. However, if
they roll less than this but miss, they hit, and roll for a possible A
Class Specific Grievous injury.  If they roll in the range of a blow
directly to EN, they make two rolls for a possible A Class Specific
Grievous injury, and apply all that succeed. If the check falls in the
range of a Possible Specific Grievous injury, then they make three
such rolls.

The magazine holds 7 rounds. 

It is somewhat inaccurate and is treated as a thrown weapon. Howewver,
if the target is German or Austrian, then the wielder will know and
may subtract 5 from the result of the Strike Check. If the target is a
Nazi, they roll twice and take the best result.

Julska Kriza never starts the reloading process until the magazine is
empty.  One bullet is added to the magaine on the last night of the
next Full Moon.  While left undisturbed, this will continue until the
magazine is full.

## The Atashdan of Ormuz

This bronze rounded and hinged rectangle is 5 cms long by 3 cms wide
by 1/2 cm thick and weighs 3 oz.

If it is placed within a hex of a bonfire, it will absorb it over the
passage of an hour, leaving nothing but ash.  This can only be done
once in any given day, but will fully charge the device, which will
then hold three flames.

Laying the device on the ground, using three flames and a Pass Action,
a bonfire can be released which will spread to cover a megahex in a
Pulse.  By using two flames they may use a Free Act to Prepare a Fire
College Spell.

By using a flame and a Pass Action, they may recover up to 5 FT lost
to Spell Casting alone.


## Blotte the Blot

Blotte is a small, vaguely aware amoeba of darkest sepia that would
like a properly decorated ink well to lie around in. It is big enough
to fill a sherry glass and weighs a single fluid ounce.

It can drink most liquids, but any attempt to bud generates an
'offspring' fluid incapable of reproduction. This sterile offspring is
ephemeral and will not last longer than an hour. It may, however, be
used as ink which will have the properties associated with whatever
Blotte last drank.

>Example: If Blotte has drunk a poison, then a poisonous ink may be
>    budded, and a single page of an enchiridion (about A5 in size),
>    may be written.  Whoever reads the page is affected by the poison
>    but may avoid the effects by rolling under 1 × their EN.  The
>    effect of the poison is calculated at 1/10th the level of
>    toxicity of the original poison, multiplied by the author's Skill
>    in Calligraphy or Illumination, but never greater than the
>    original.  Once read, the poison is stripped from the message and
>    can only be detected by Divining Enchantment if that Adept is
>    also a Calligrapher, Alchemist or Illuminator of at least equal
>    Rank.

If the appointments of Blotte's inkwell do not meet with its approval,
it may decline to bud at all and may well sulk. And spit. This does
little harm but will reduce the target's PB for a week. It always
hits.

In any case, Blotte's nature is corrosive given its diet, and the
appointment's must be regularly replaced, which will cost 11 tsg a
year.

## The Sarcophagus of Endless Night

This sarcophagus is made of a light, dry wood that feels spongy to the
touch, and weighs barely 31 lbs.  It is cedarwood, though very
dessicated.

If a mummy is placed within it for 2,500 years, then once a century,
it will produce enough Dust of Ages to fill the palm of a child one
does not especially like.  If the dust is carefully collected by
someone else for whom one holds no special affection, then there is
enough to fill the palm of three children one does not especially
like.

## The Remains of Hat-Kharten, Scribe-Priestess of Seshat

This mummy weighs 23 lbs, most of which is the finery of her robes.
Divination reveals that she served the goddess of writing and
measurement and her role was to record the pharaoh's Sed festivals.
Her name was lost and she is only known as 'the Wife of Kharten', but
no other record of him survives.


## Nightmare Robes
These robes are the colour of migraines and nausea. 

They weigh 2 lbs, provide 3 points of Protection, 7 Spell Armour but
these protections do not stack with those provided from cloth, leather
or metal armour.

They automatically halve damage from Telekinetic Rage, and their
weight is divided by 3 when they are the target of Telekinesis.  The
wearer triples the weight they can lift when they are the target of
their own Telekinesis spell and in that case they spend 1 less FT, to
a minimum of 1.

Sleeping in these robes opens the wearer's mind to strange, twisted
visitations, preventing any recovery of FT for the first four hours

## Avant-Bras of Shielding

This vambrace is made from the iridescently blue, partially metallic
carapace of a massive beetle from another realm. It weighs 3 lbs.  It
does not add to Protection, Endurance Armour or Damage Reduction.
While it is worn, the wearer may ignore these Specific Grievous
Injuries:

06–07
: Oh no! Your opponent’s weapon has entered your left arm’s elbow
joint and the tip has broken off. Take 2 Damage Points immediately
from Endurance and that arm is useless until the sliver has been
removed by a Healer of Rank 3 or above.  Also, increase the chance of
infection by 30.

09–10
: You have been stabbed in your left arm.  Drop whatever you were
holding in it and take 2 Damage Points immediately from Endurance. It
will take a full week for the arm to be of any use to you whatsoever.

26–27
: Bad luck! Your left hand has been severed at the wrist. Take 2
Damage Points to Endurance immediately and 1 point per pulse from
Fatigue thereafter (Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) until you are
dead or the bleeding is staunched by a Healer of Rank 0 or above. If
you live, reduce your MD by 2.

61–67
: Your left arm is crippled by a wicked slash!  Take 2 damage Points
immediately to Endurance and drop anything you have in your primary
hand.  The arm is unusable until healed, which should take 2 months.

Note: If the result is:

44–50
: A slash along one arm, and it’s a bleeder! Take 2 Damage Points
immediately from Endurance and lose 1 point from Fatigue (Endurance
when Fatigue is exhausted) each pulse until the bleeding is stopped by
a Healer of Rank 1 or above or you die.

then the wearer rolls a D10 and a D5. If the D5 result is greater than
the D10, then the injury is applied to the right arm.  In all cases
where a Specific Grievous Injury is ignored, the weapon's damage is
still applied directly to EN, modified by Endurance Armour and/or
Damage Reduction.

The vambrace can store three shields, none greater than a human-sized
tower shield. Stored shields encumber at 1/3rd of their weight.

Three times a day, resetting at dusk, an equipped shield may be
swapped for a stored shield. This is a Reflex Action.

A new shield may be added to the vambrace at dusk on a Tuesday the
process taking until the fall of night, but in any case, can hold no
more than three.

## Wand of Heat Transfer

This long wand is 23 inches long but weighs 7 oz and is made from the
tip of a Biahkee's wing bone.  Although hollow, it is as strong as
tempered steel.

It is a Spell Rack.

Once a day, resetting at dawn, a Fire spell Cast through the wand can
be reversed to manifest its effects as cold.

Reversing non-damagiing spells like, say, Wildfires to create an icy
path and traverse water is a worthy challenge.  A book on the
consequences of such attempts is being kept in Seagate.

## Potion of Improved Healing

This potion weighs 4 oz, and need not be Prepared before it can be
used if it is attached to a convenient belt or strap on the hip or
torso.

Once taken, the potion heals 3 rollup D10 + 8 damage

## Ring of Terror

This ring is made from a transparent metal as ductile as gold.  It
weighs 3 oz and must be worn on the middle finger of the wielder's
right hand, which digit will turn as black as a witch's heart.

It is a Spell Rack, but its matrices may only be used for Incantations
of Phantasm or Nightmare spells.  Matrices bought for the ring are
advanced separately to any other Spell Rack.

## Coffin Nails × 11

These cigarettes are so black as not to reflect any light. The tobacco
is dark, fibrous and moist, and when it burns, smells of burning boot
leather.

They may be used to create a miracle pool for a cunning master
plan. The consumer comes up with a plan and re advised to make it as
as general as practical. Key elements may need more explanation as the
DM sees fit.

Having determined the plan, the consumer may choose to smoke a Coffin
Nail, sacrifice 1 or more PC points to provide a reroll should their
alarms fail or some secure line of communication fails to resist being
decrypted.

The consumer may choose to smoke a Coffin Nail, sacrifice 1 or more WP
points which will provide a reroll for each of their hench entities if
they succumb to threats, bribes or seduction, fail to obey
instructions, keep to their assigned timetable or attempt to flee
combat.

The consumer may choose to smoke a Coffin Nail, sacrifice 1 or more EN
points, which will provide a reroll for anything else that fails.

Once the PC, WP and EN points have been spent, the consumer may choose
to specify what they are guarding against, and the DM is enjoined to
be generous in this. Or, they can leave it in the hands of the DM who
will make determinations based on their understanding of the
situation.

All PC, WP and EN points may be bought back in the normal way.

## Formula of the Oil of Prying (Rank 4 Alchemy)

On a Tuesday, upon the westering of the sun, buy, without haggling a
sheep, lamb or goat. Take from it the heart, liver and kidneys,
cutting from it the hard, white fat theereof.  Give this unto a boy of
twelve, yea, and with a pot great enough that he may wear it upon his
head. Let the fat be laid into the water, yea and with the dessicated
eye of an owl and as much dried sage as will fill the hand of a boy of
twelve.  Charge such a boy to watch as it heats that it boileth not,
for it must soften in like wise as the expression of a boy of twelve
hardens.  When it has been reduced by half, pour it through a cloth of
fine linen, doubled twice, unto a clean alembic.

Discard the cloth and restore the emulsion with clean water five
times. But, on the last occasion, do not restore the emulsion. It may
be that a boy of twelve, spurning the burden, requireth a bribe. But a
sum as great as six pennies be so great as to strike at the special
trust between Alchemist and apprentice. Yea, and it be better to boil
a boy of twelve down for his virgin fat than to weaken in the face of
this avarice.

If a boy of twelve has not been boiled down for his virgin fat, then
pour off the oil but none of the water into a pot that holdeth but a
finger of salamoniac and leave it to settle for the passing of a day.
Remove the finger, and it will now be a grey soap that is harsh and
grainy, but the oil will be clear and light. To test that the
operation has been successful, leave in the pot until noon of the day
thereafter, and if it hardens, then it has failed.  Otherwise, pour
into glass phials as long as a man's least finger and about as wide.

The oil costs 1 truesilver guinea to produce a phial and the chance to
produce it is MA + 6 times Alchemist Rank. An Alchemist can produce as
many phials as 1 for every 2 Ranks, and, regardless of Rank, no more
oil than 10 drams may be produced by a single operation (each phial
containing 2 drams of the oil) and weighing 1/4 of an ounce in total.

The oil is a superfluid and if pooured onto an entity, object or area
no greater than seven hexes, even though the dose is tiny, it will
spread to cover it within a minute. The Adept can Cast the Ritual of
Flame Sight, which, if successful, reveals the following information:
The nature of all magic in effect (exact names and Colleges).  If the
magic has no College, then the general effects are revealed. In the
case of magic that is no longer in effect, for each 5 points under the
Cast Chance that the Adept rolled, magic that expired an extra week
ago is revealed. For example, if an Adept rolled under their Cast
Chance by 12, magic that expired up to two weeks ago would be revealed
— in addition to all magic currently in effect.

If the Adept wishes they may choose to pry deeper, by reducing the
base Cast Chance to 20% and increasing the Cast Time to 3 hours. If
successful the Adept will learn the exact nature of all enchantments,
magical mechanisms, triggering conditions, curses, side effects, etc.,
placed upon an entity or object even if the origin is not founded upon
a College. If an object has an Individual True Name this deeper prying
will reveal its existence, though not the actual name.

## The Jewelled Bracer of the Pit of Eitr

This jewelled bracer is 18 cms long. It is made from brass and bands
of black jade, weighing 13 oz. It is a fetching ornament for a woman's
left forearm, if a little creepy. It is a vambrace, providing 4 points
of Defence and allowing the wearer to ignore Specific Grievous
Injuries to the left wrist, forearm and elbow, but not the damage. In
other words, the damage is still applied but the limb is not
specifically damaged.

A catch on the bracer may be pressed, which will reveal a similarly
bejewelled wasp which is 15 cms long and weighs 7 oz. It's wings are
carved from delicate panes of carnelian.

Once a day, resetting at dawn, it is a legal target for a weapon
spell, except Dark Sword, Shadowed Sword, Spectral Weapon or Rune
Weapon.

 * has a Defence of 42 on the ground, 62 in the air
 * doubles range penalties
 * is treated as a creature of the element that animates it

The wasp may be directed to attack a target by the Animator if they
are able to maintain communication with it. This does not require a
Pass Action upon launch of the wasp. However, they are required when
changing targets.

It does not benefit from Rituals of Enchantment.

It is treated as a Dart and has the Animator's Skill with it.

Weapons
: Dart: BC 40%, [D + 2], A Class, Ranged, Close, Rank = Animator's.

Damage and Strike Chance increase as determined by the weapon spell,
and the Animator's Skill.

It does not have a rating for Melee, since it will mostly attack by
executing a Dive Action every other Pulse. It may, however, land on a
target to deliver attacks every Pulse, which are rated as Close.

The wasp does not benefit from the Healing Skill or magic, but can be
Mended. It will recover 1 point of damage lost from EN every four days
it is not used and 1 point of FT every hour once EN is fully
recovered.

Note: The wasp does not really have a PS value of 9, this merely
represents how difficult it is to hit and the amount of mayhem it may
engender as a consequence of panic.

## Yellow Potion of Health 

This potion weighs 4 oz and need not be Prepared before it can be used
if it is attached to a convenient belt or strap. The potion will break
if the DM decides that the owner may have unsuccessfully avoided a
powerful blow, and a percentile roll to avoid destruction exceeds 70.

This potion can only be used once in a 5 second period of time, cures
2 rollup D10 points of damage, does not require a Pass Action, and in
fact can only be taken during the Military Scientist Time Out phase.
If there is no Military Scientist to provide a Time Out, the potion
does nothing.

## The Utility Lamp of Lost Ubar

The compact, brass-bound lantern is made for engineers, riggers, and
mechanists who work in dim boiler rooms. Its housing is cylindrical,
made from polished brass plates riveted together with thick copper
seams. A set of vented louvres near the top allows heat to escape,
each one shaped like the gills of a mechanical fish.

A reinforced glass chimney—slightly smoked and etched with geometric
engraving—protects the interior glow. Inside, a coil of amber
filaments pulses like bottled lightning, powered by a miniature
alchemical battery: a clockwork dynamo wound by a side-mounted
key. When the lamp is shaken, the filaments stutter and re-brighten as
if waking from sleep.

A hinged cage of brass bars can be snapped over the glass to protect
it during fieldwork. The handle is a comfortable, leather-wrapped grip
attached to an articulated copper arm, allowing it to swivel and lock
at various angles. Beneath the base, tiny rubberised feet prevent it
from sliding across metal floorplates and the like.

When activated, the lamp gives off a steady, warm amber light with
faint motes of gold drifting inside the glass—residue of the aetheric
charge. A small dial allows the user to shift between low glow, full
beam, and hazard strobe, each setting producing a different hum from
the internal dynamo. On overload, the lamp emits a soft, electrical
whir, as if frustrated steam was trapped inside.

Once a day, by wiping it down with a clean rag, the genie within may
be summoned for no longer than four hours. Work that takes longer than
four hours will not be undertaken until an emolument of 1 truesilver
guinea is paid for the first overtime hour, doubling every overtime
hour thereafter. The maximum number of overtime hours is four and
luncheon is expected after the second overtime hour.

## Ymir, The Genie of the Utility Lamp

Ymir is a small technodjinn 45 cms tall who wears a red bolero jacket
and a lemon-coloored turban with a dark green sarpech.  His skin
colour is brown with intensely green eyes and he has a finely dressed
moustache which he often strokes while affecting depth of thought.  He
is nothing of the sort, being impulsive and driven by his passions.

He is a member of the College of Air Magic, and knows all of the
General Knowledge magic at Rank 6, except for Purification, which is
Rank 10. He also knows the Air Spring Ritual at Rank 6.

## Binding Air (Q-1)

Duration
: 2 hours + 2 / Rank (8 hours)

Experience Multiple
: 300

Base Chance
: MA + 3 / Rank (35%)

Cast Time
: 30 minutes

Effects
: The Adept may gain control of the element of air by using this
ritual. The Adept may 1000 cubic feet of air (+ 500 / Rank) (4,000
cubic feet). They may do anything with the element, even tethering an
Air Sprite to a location. This will require regular propitiation of
the Sprite of 1 truesilver guinea a month in special incenses and
perfumes. This creature can guard the volume it is set to watch over
and Bind the air therein. It's chance to detect a threat is 18 + 1 /
Rank (24%).

This may be made permanent by Binding the Sprite to a polished Tempest
Stone at least as big as a stone mason's thumb nail and costing at
least 13 truesilver guineas. A point of EN must be sacrificed by the
Adept or another sentient entity to the stone.

This ritual may not be used over an area occupied by an elemental and
cannot be used in any way to control an elemental.

## Air Spring (R-1)

Duration
: Rank × Rank hours (36 hours)

Experience Multiple
: 150

Base Chance
: MA + 5% / Rank (47%)

Resist
: None

Storage
: None

Target
: Area

Cast Time
: 1 hour

Material
: None

Actions
: None

Concentration Check
: Standard

Effects
: The Adept can open a one way portal 2 feet in diameter to the
elemental plane of Air from which fresh, clean air flows.  The rate of
flow is 5 cubic feet (+ 5 / Rank) per second (35 cubic feet per
second, 125 cubic feet per Pulse).  Additionally any modifier for
being enclosed is reduced by 5.

Ymir is a Rank 3 Courtier and has taken Dress Sense & Entertaining
once each, but has chosen Bureaucracy three times, so acts as if he is
Rank 5 at it.

Ymir never earns Experience directly, it must be surrendered to him by
one who retains his services.  His services are always for at least a
year and a day, and may be extended by the same amount.  His services
are exclusive, although, obviously, they maay be passed between
friends and allies or sold to the highest bidder.

He will not serve if he is not recompensed in some way. This includes
Experience to advance his statistics and abilities.  He is generally
biddable, adhering to the desires of whoever holds his services.  On
each occasion, %ile dice are rolled, and if less than 90, Ymir's plans
accord with whoever holds his service.  If 90 or higher, then he will
spend as much of the Experience as possible on random advances.

Range
: 15 feet + 15 / Rank

Duration
: Immediate, during Pulse

Resist
: Active, Passive

Target
: Entity

Effects
: The target of this spell is seized by uncontrollable fear and must
  roll on the Fright table. At the time of casting, the Adept may
  choose to modify the Fright Table roll up or down by an amount up to
  the rank of the spell. On a double or triple effect this
  modification may be doubled or tripled respectively.

Cost
: 1000 Experience.

Constraints

## Phantasm - Inquisition

Range
: 15 feet + 15 / Rank

Duration
: Special

Resist
: Active, Passive

Target
: Entity

Effects
: The Adept can, by pointing at an entity, cause them extreme
  pain. Those who Resist reduce their Strike Chances by 30 and may
  only act every second Pulse until they Recover.

Those who fail can only take a Pass Action every second Pulse until
they Recover. While the Adept points at them, requiring Concentration
and a Pass Action, the victim suffers 1 point of damage for every 4
Ranks and is denied any opportunity to Recover.

Recovery Chance

Rank   Difficulty
---    ---
0–4    4 × WP
5–9    3 × WP
10–14  2 × WP
15–19  1 × WP
20     1/2 WP

Recovery checks are made at the end of every Pulse, if they are not denied.

Cost
: 4000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 4 

##  Hypnotism - Hypnos' Mist of Dreams

Duration
: Duration: 5 minutes

Effects
: This incantation allows the Adept to fill a spherical volume one hex
in diameter with a mist which can only be seen by those whose Rank in
Witchsight or Enhanced Vision is at least equal ton the Rank of the
spell. The diameter increases by two hexes for every 10 Ranks.

Entities must roll under 3 × WP to avoid drifting off to sleep until
they leave the volume. The effect of the incantation is subtle, and
even if a target saves against the effect, must Break (100 + Rank in
Hypnotism) and adding the value of their MA and PC to the result.

Victims that succumb to the incantation will sleep until the duration
expires or until they have recovered all of their FT, whichever
happens last.

Cost
: 2000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 1 

## Personalised Illusion - Nightingale Floor

Range
: 5 feet / Rank

Duration
: 1 hour (+ 30 minutes / Rank)

Effects
: This incantation of the Personalised Illusion spell requires the
sacrifice of a nightingale. Upon Casting, the Adept enchants Rank ×
Rank contiguous hexes of terrain, penalising any attempt to cross it
using Stealth by three times the Rank of the spell.

Cost
: 750 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, requires the sacrifice of a nightingale

## Summoning Earth Elemental - Summon Glint

Duration
: 5 minutes (+1 / Rank)

Effects
: If the Cast is successful, Glint appears with EN of 10 and FT
  of 15. The summoner may assign points to either stat from a pool of
  4 / Rank, with maximum EN of 40 and FT of 75.

Note: Glint does not need to be Controlled, but while under its effect, cannot be Banished.

Description
: Glint is a glass elemental in the shape of a scorpion. At Rank 0, it
  is the size of a wolf, growing to two hexes large at Rank 10 and
  three hexes large at Rank 20.

Comments
: Glint comes from a fractured plane but does not return there if it
is not connected to the ground. It is sentient, but it's thought
processes are multi-faceted and alien.  It's mind is not particularly
difficult to detect, but very difficult to read. Any attempt to do
this requires the Telepath to Break (100 + the Rank of the Spell of
Summoning Earth Elemental) and adding their MA and WP to the
result.  Failure indicates 5 points of Confusion, each requiring a Pass
Action to void.

Abilities
: Glint has Enhanced Vision at the same Rank as the spell that summons
him. In addition, he can become Transparent for a number of Pulses
equal to half the Rank of the summoning spell.  This can only be
penetrated with Enhanced Vision of at least equal Rank.
	
While concealed in this manner, Glint's Defence increases by 30 and he
may not be targeted at range.

Glint takes half damage from weapons on the Swords table and from fire
damage but takes twice as much from C Class damage. It does not Stun.

Base TMR is 8, but increases by 1 at Rank 10 and Rank 20.

Movement Rates
: Running: 400 

+-------------------------+------------------+---------------------+
| PS: 20 + (2/Rank)       | MD: 12 + (Rank)  | AG: 16 + (1/2 Rank) |
+-------------------------+------------------+---------------------+
| MA: 8                   | EN: 10 + Special | FT: 15 + Special    |
+-------------------------+------------------+---------------------+
| WP: 18                  | PC: 5 + (Rank)   | PB: 8               |
+-------------------------+------------------+---------------------+
| TMR: 8  + (1/10 Ranks)  | NA: Scales absorb 8 DP                 |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------+

Weapons
: Glint may attack with each claw and stinger in a single Pulse. If
  both claws hit, then it gains the Bite as an extra attack.

 -  Damage increases by 1 for every Rank that is not zero and not a prime.
 -   Claw:    BC 53%, [D + 4], C Class, Melee, Weapon Rank = Spell Rank / 3.
 -   Bite:    BC 38%, [D + 2], B Class, Close, Melee at Rank 10+, Weapon Rank = Spell Rank / 5.
 -   Stinger: BC 63%, [D + 6], A Class, Melee, 10 feet at Rank 10, 15 feet at Rank 20, Weapon Rank = Spell Rank / 3.
 -   When it is a multi-hex creature, Glint gets a free Trample attack against every opponent in the volume it occupies:
   * Trample: BC 38%, [2 rollup D10] C Class Damage, Close
 -   When it is a three hex creature:
   * Trample: BC 48%, [3 rollup D10] C Class Damage, Close

Cost
: 3750 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 2 

## Fire Arc - Saint Catherine's Wheel

Target
: Icon of Saint Catherine

Effects
: The Adept charges an Icon of Saint Catherine which lasts until the
next dawn.  Once it is exhausted, it cannot be charged again until
then. While it is charged, it contains a pool of extra movement that
is equal to 1 hex for each Rank in the Spell of Fire Arc: 1 at Rank 0,
21 at Rank 20, and the most that can be spent in a single Pulse is
1/3rd of the total.  The movement is additional to their TMR but is
not considered TMR.  It can be in any direction, so long as it passes
through an unobscured hex. Thus, movement is allowed up, down,
sideways, backwards etc.  Using the extra movement does not attract
the penalties that using TMR can.  For example, the wearer could
specifically choose not to use their TMR, instead using this
additional movement to travel to a target and deliver a melee attack
with a non-pole weapon and without attracting a penalty.

Icon of Saint Catherine
: This miniature icon is an image of Saint Catherine painted onto a
cartouche of jet 15 cms long by 7 cms wide and 1/2 a cm thick.  The
paints must be made brightly coloured gems, ground to a fine dust,
steeped in naphtha and mixed with an equal amount of oil of the
phoenix palm.  The painting must be a masterwork of an artisan painter
who specialises in miniatures.

This will cost 21 tsg.

If the Adept chooses to consume the icon, their AG is increased by 1
for every five Ranks in the spell which will last until the pool is
exhausted.  In addition, they may transform into a Catherine Wheel one
megahex across.  The Wheel spins and burns with silvery flames. It can
execute a Charge Action that covers a number of hexes equal to three
times the Adept's modified TMR and may move three dimensionally
without restriction.  Once invoked, it automatically exhausts any
unused movement from the pool.  Anything that comes into contact with
the Wheel suffers 1 rollup D10 fire damage for every four Ranks,
Resisting for half.  Once the Wheel has terminated all of its
movement, the spell ends.

Cost
: 4000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, requires an Icon of Saint Catherine, reduces FT value by 2.

## Immolation - Embrace of the Fire Serpent

Effects
: The Adept is wrapped in the fiery embrace of a burning cobra, which
will provide 2 Defence (+3 for every 2 Rank).  As a Free Act, the
Adept can extinguish the flames of the cobra, preventing it from doing
any damage. They may, also as a Free Act, ignite the cobra so that it
will inflict 1 point of Fire damage for every even Rank.

While it is alight, the cobra may be used to deliver a venomous
bite. The Strike Chance is calculated from the Adept's Skill with
Dagger and inflicts D10+3 A Class damage.  Bonsues from Rituals of
Enchantment, weapon spells and similar effects are ignored, however.

For every three ranks in the spell, the Penetration of the bite is
increased by 1.  If effective damage is done, a Burning Venom is
injected into the victim which inflicts 1 point of damage for three
Pulses, increaseing to 2 points of damage for six Pulses at Rank 10
and 3 points of damage for nine Pulses at Rank 20.

Subsequent envenomations stack.

Cost
: 2500 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 2.

## Slow Fire - The Bearable Lightness of Being

Range
: Self

Duration
: 5 minutes (+5 / Rank)

Target
: Entity

Effects
: The Adept glows with a warm, faint light and may alter their weight
once per Pulse as a Reflex Action for the duration. Their weight may
be reduced by 1/20th of normal weight per Rank, beginning at Rank 0.

Falling Effects by Rank

 ~ Ranks 0–4: The Adept may avoid harm from a fall by Breaking 100 and adding the spell’s Rank.
 ~ Ranks 5–10: The Adept may avoid harm from a fall by Breaking 100 and adding the spell’s Rank and their AG.
 ~ Ranks 11–15: The Adept may avoid harm from a fall by Breaking 100 and adding twice the spell’s Rank and their AG.
 ~ Ranks 16–18: The Adept takes no damage from a fall unless landing on hazardous terrain (spikes, blades, etc.).
 ~ Rank 19: The Adept becomes buoyant in air, though cannot ascend.
 ~ Rank 20: The Adept may rise into the air at TMR 3 in the first Pulse, TMR 5 in the second Pulse, reaching a maximum climb rate of  TMR 6 from the third Pulse onward.

The Adept may add the spell’s Rank to Acrobatics checks.  Certain
feats normally considered impossible may become feasible at the DM’s
discretion.  No horizontal movement is provided by this magic,
although the Adept will be affected by the wind.

Cost
: 1000 Experience

Constraints
: Unracks the spell 

## Mental Attack - Mind Blast

Name
: Mind Blast

Spell
: Mental Attack

Effects
: This incantation of Mental Attack fills a volume that is 5 ft wide
  (+1 per Rank) and 15 ft long (+5 per Rank). Entities in the area are
  not knocked unconscious, but any who fail to resist find themselves
  confused and disorganised, and may not act until they have spent 1
  Pass Action for every 3 or fraction Ranks. At Rank 20, this
  increases to a maximum of 8 Pass Actions.

If victims of this effect are attacked even if no damage is done, then
they may Break 100: PC + WP + Sense Danger to recover their senses.

Cost
: 1000 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 2.

## Mental Attack - Creeping Senility

Range
: 15 ft + 15 ft / Rank

Duration
: Permanent

Resist
: Passive

Target
: Living sentient entity

Effects
: This incantation can be targeted at a single sentient entity within
  range.  If they fail to Resist vs the Special Knowledge magic of the
  College of the Sorceries of the Mind or the College of Illusions,
  whichever is worse, then they immediately lose 5 WP and 2 MA.  Every
  dawn, their MA is reduced by another point, until they are reduced
  to 0 and fall into a coma.

This is a Major Curse.

Cost
: 500 Experience.

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 1.

This incantation is not teachable.
