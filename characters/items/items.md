## Ultimate Outdoors Manual

This read must study this book for a week and then will permanently
gain +5% to all ranger base chances.  After it is read the book will
disappear [Used].

## Ribbon of Clarity

This is a brightly striped rank 8 silk ribbon made by Athena's lesser
handmidens.

It will add 12% to the wearer's magic resistance vs general knowledge
spells of the College of Sorceries of the Mind.

The ribbon must be tied into the wearer's head hair, and takes one day
(24 hours) to adjust to the wearer before the bonus will apply.

## Brided Lanyard

This is a rank 8 metallic black braid formed from a repetitive series
of complex knots made by Athena's lesser handmaidens.

The wielder will never involuntarily drop the weapon to which the
braid is attached, and can choose to ignore disarm attempts for this
weapon.

The ribbon must be tied onto a specific weapon (it will not impede
use) and takes one day (24 hours) to adjust to the wapon before
bonuses will apply.

## Liquid Moonlight

This small vial of liquid contains a distillation that confers extra
potency to blades when upon them.  It must be applied to a blade under
the full moon and retains its properties till the next full moon.
During this time the blade will glisten like moonlight upon water, and
will do double damage to shapeshifters of any type and in any form,
including lycanthropes, etc (doppelgangers included).  This may be
placed on magical weapons (within reason) [Used].

## Dark Vison

Jedburgh has gained the talents of Dark Vision (as per Celestial
College spell) and Spirit Vision (can see disembodied spirits).

## Spectal Weapons

Jedburgh has a hand & a half, glaive, short sword and two dagger with
Rank 19 Spectral Weapon permanently on them.

## Glaive of Flame

This glaive is a magic weapon based upon a Rank 4 weaponsmithed (+1
damage) silvered blade.  It has obviously been rehafted several times
(it may not be rehfted as any other type of weaopon and have the
magical effects).  In addition it is imbused with a very old Weapon of
Flames style of magic.  The original intention is to be flaming all
the time but over the last 3,000 years the magic has waned somewhat
until now the magic nees some assistance to get going.  The blade must
be lit by some means before the magic will take affect.  Any magical
flame or ignition talent will automatically start the magic in one
pulse as will a small campefire sized flame.  Sparks, such as from a
tinderbox, have a 33% change of igniting the weapon per pulse and a
candle will have a 50% chance of igniting the glaive per pulse.

One lit the glaive will burn for 5 minutes and cannot be used again
for 3 hours.  Whilst burning the glaive is under the effect of a Rank
10 Weapon of Flames spell with all the normal benefits, i.e. +4
magical damage and +10% to Hit (+10 damage vs Cold based creatures and
Undead).

In total this makes the glaive D+10 damage & +10% Strike Chance.

## Wormskin Armour

This armour cam from the skin of a lesser worm and is a dark grey in colour.

-----------     ----------
Protection      9
Weight factor   4
Agility modifer 2
Base value      20,000 sp
-----------     ----------

It was improved by the dwarves of the Superstition Mountains to Rank

-----------     ----------
Protection      10
Weight factor   4
Agility modifer 1
Base value      22,500 sp
-----------     ----------

The armour has worm's teath edged gauntlets, which can be used as
cestii.

## Prowess

Prowess is a special Adventuring Skill that may only be advanced once
per adventure or season, whichever is least. It increases the Strike
Chance of a Melee or Close Attack by 5 per Rank.

The Experience Multiple of this special Skill is 500.

## Claw of the Nephilim

This claw and forearm has been preserved so that it may be worked on
by a Weaponsmith who knows how to make hafted and experimental
weapons.

## Shield of Chaos

This octagonal shield weighs 5 lbs and is made of some iridescent,
shell like material. It penalises MD by 2 but provides 5 Defence (+5
per Rank).

If it can be presented against an attack (i.e. a visible attack that
approaches through the bearer's front hexes), then a D20 is rolled. If
the result is a prime, then this amount is deducted from the damage.
Note: 1 is not a prime.


## Winged Helm 

This helmet has wide, wing-like flanges on either side, and the face
is open. It weighs 2 lbs, and allows the wearer to roll 2 × MD
percentile chance to avoid a specific grievous injury to the skull
(but not the eyes).

The "wings" can store 3 points of the wearer's TMR to be used at a
later time. Increasing the TMR reservoir costs 1,000 Experience each
and takes the morning half of a week of Skill Training Time.
 
The reservoir may be replenished one at a time by reducing the
wearer's TMR by one for ten minutes, once per day.  The TMR stored can
be transferred directly to the wearer,. For so long as TMR remains in
the reservoir, the wearer can increase their own by one or more, once
per Pulse.

The helmet must be worn under the open sky for at least eight
consecutive days to attune it.

## Spell of Name Change

Range
: Self

Duration
: Conc. Max 30 minutes + 30 minutes per Rank

Experience Multiple
: 275

Base Chance
: 1%

Resist
: None

Storage
: Potion

Target
: Sentient Entity

Effects
: The Adept assumes the form or seeming of something whose Name they have Ranked.

If they wish to assume a physical form, then they must have at least
Rank 10 in its GTN.  When they transform they acquire the lowest value
of the creature's physical stats: PS, MD, AG, PB and EN.  They retain
their own MA, WP, FT and PC. For every 2 Ranks in the GTN in excess of
10 they may add 1 to the form's physical stats.  The Adept may not
transform into a fantastical or sentient creature, nor one that weighs
less than a few ounces (about the size of a mouse) nor more than
1000lbs (up to a large bull, but not a fully grown ox).

The cost to transform themselves is 12 FT - 1 per 2 Ranks in the spell.

They may assume the seeming of anything whose GTN they know.  This
will engage all of the usual senses.  The size of the seeming can be
no more than 1 hex per 3 or fraction Ranks in the Name.  It is much
harder to make a seeming that is smaller, however.  If the Adept has
Rank 10 in a Name, they can take the seeming of something half their
size, one quarter their size at Rank 20.  The limits on a seeming are
much less constrained than for a transformation.  However, the
appearance of a particular entity can be assumed only if their
Individual True Name is known.  In addition, the spell can only be
sustained for either 30 minutes + 30 minutes per Rank of the spell or
10 minutes + 10 minutes per Rank of the ITN, whichever is lowest.

Each time an observer has reason to question the seeming, then they
are allowed a Magic Resistance versus Namer Special Knowlege magic.
The roll is penalised by the Rank of the Name used, but the observers
gain a bonus to MR of their PC. If they fail this roll, but
subsequently have reason to doubt the seeming again, they may make
another roll.  If they resist, they are undeceived.  Seemings never
inflict any damage.  Indeed, physical contact sharp enough to require a
Strike Check will cause the seeming to dissipate.

The cost to change their appearance is 6 FT - 1 per 4 Ranks in the
spell.

This spell is not teachable to others.

This robe is made from voidsilk, and is the colour of migraines. It

sacrifice a point of EN to bind the robes to them.  Once bound, it has

- +1 WP
- 6 points of Protection and 8 points of Spell Armour which will stack

## Incantation of Spell Magazine

Spell
: Smoking Magma

Range
: 25 feet + 5 / Rank

Duration
: Special

Base Chance
: 7%

Resist
: Passive

Target
: Object/Entity

Effects
: This incantation of Smoking Magma gains a number of Prepare Actions
  equal to 1 (+1 for every three Ranks) so that they may Cast a Magma
  Bolt, which will fly from their hand to hit an object or entity.
  Since the Prepare Actions have already been stored into the Spell
  Magazine, the Adept simply makes a Cast Action to Fire a Magma Bolt
  which inflicts 1 roll-up D10 + Rank fire damage, Resist for
  half.  The FT cost is paid for each bolt, however.

The magazine lasts for 10 seconds (+10 seconds per Rank) or until all
Cast Actions have been used.

Cost
: 3000

Constraints
: Unracks the spell, reduces FT value by 3.

## Enhancing Enchantment

Callas has been granted the spell of Enhancing Enchantment (S7 of the
College of Ensorcelments and Enchantments) as an out of College,
unteachable, Special Knowledge spell.  As such it does not gain any bonuses
from Earth College modifiers (e.g. Place of Power) but nor is it subject to
the College restrictions (i.e. it can be cast even if Callas is not in
contact with the earth).  Because it's therugic nature is slightly at odds
with elemental magic, Callas will find it a little harder to learn and cast
than normal. (EM slightly higher and BC slightly lower). Otherwise it
operates in exactly the same fashion as the E&E spell:

Range
: 15 feet + 15 / Rank

Duration
: 10 seconds + 5 / Rank

Experience Multiple
: 350

Base Chance
: 20%

Resist
: None

Storage
: Investment, Ward

Target
: Area

Effects
: The Rank of this spell is added to the Rank of one characteristic of
any spell being cast within the area of effect. Note that the actual
Rank of the affected spell is unchanged — only the effect of one
characteristic is enhanced (as per double and triple effects).  While
casting the Spell of Enhancing Enchantment, the adept specifies the
spell characteristic to be affected. Only Range, Duration, Base
Chance, or where appropriate) Damage, may be affected by this spell.

A spell may never have a characteristic enhanced by Ranks greater than its
own rank by the use of this spell (e.g. a Rank 6 spell that is cast within
a Rank Spell of Enhancing Enchantment will only gain the effects of 6 extra
ranks in the affected characteristic). Only spells that are cast are
affected, not spells being released from any form of storage.

The caster of the subject spell will be aware that their spell is being
affected by enhancement during the pulse that they are preparing (as per
high or low Mana). They will not know which characteristic is being
affected nor the amount of enhancement. They may not restrict the effect of
the enhancement, but may reduce the spell effects in the normal manner. If
an attempt is made to cast a Spell of Enhancing Enchantment on an area that
has some part of it under the effects of another Spell of Enhancing
Enchantment, then the second spell will fail.

Special Duration, Range, or Damage effects may be caused by the use of this
spell (e.g. Duration of Lesser Enchantment at Rank 20).

## Return to True Form

Once a quarter -- at exactly noon on each of the four high holidays of the
year -- Callas's True Form will be restored as though a Rank 20 Ritual of
True Form (R6 of the College of Naming Incantation) had just been
successfully completed upon her.  As a reference for the GM the effects of
this Ritual are:

Effects
: By means of this ritual the Adept may force a target that has been
magically altered, cursed, or rearranged into a form other than their
natural one to assume their true form and nature. It will not remove
effects that could occur naturally. For example, the ritual would restore
the form of a human that had been cursed into the shape of a toad, and
would return to flesh a human turned to stone but would do nothing to
remove a curse of weeping sores or restore a lost limb.

## Callas' Arresting Gaze
Range
: 10 feet (+5 feet / Rank)

Duration
: Special

Experience Multiple
: 300

Base Chance
:  Automatic

Cast Time
: Magical Fire Action

Effects
: This magic does not normally miss, and neither can it
generate Double or Triple Effects. Callas has a gaze that she can fix
on an entity or an object that can fit inside a volume of one hex (+
one hex for every ten Ranks). Objects or entities of greater size
cannot normally be affected.

The effects of the gaze are Avoided or Opposed, not Resisted, and if
this is done, then nothing happens to them. For a target that
succumbs, however, the current Pulse does not end for them . They do
not lose Actions directly, however, abilities that reset at the end of
the current Pulse or the beginning of the next will not be renewed as
the Future is warded away from them. Similarly, entities afflicted
with continuous damage like bleeding wounds, Greek Fire, poison, the
End of Pulse Stun Recovery check, etc. will no longer experience them
until She lifts her gaze, and provided she maintains the cost each
Pulse. She cannot maintain the effect on multiple targets since she
can only gaze at one thing at a time but she can lift it at any time
without using any kind of Action at all.

Her gaze is Avoided if the target Breaks 100 and adds AG to the
result, or WP if the effect is to be Opposed. This halves the Stat
involved or reduces it by ten, whichever is the least, and lasts until
the end of the next Pulse.

This magic draws one from a special reserve in her 'heart' . This
starts at five, and may be raised by one at the end of an Adventure or
Season, whichever is least, at a cost of two thousand five hundred
Experience. It recovers as if it were normal FT, but only after all
normal FT has been restored.


## Ivory Wand

This wand will add 5% to the base chance of casting the Earth mage
spell of Detect Poison.

## Amulet of Luck

Made from tiger's or alligator's teeth.  It increases the wearer's
Magical Resistance by 3 and subtracts 2 from any Strike Check made
against the wearer. Cost: 2400 SP.

## Elder Flowers

Makes the wearer proof against the Evil Eye. Cost: 400 SP.

## Hypericum

Increases the wearer's Magical Resistance by 10 to any magical act
performed by a Demon or Daemonic being.  Cost: 800 SP.

## Shield of Disruption

This magical Small round Shield is of Dwarvern origin and bears a Rune
of Disruption.  Furthermore it is crafted by a Rank 10 Armourer and
its exuisite balance provides the wielder with 5% per Rank of Shield
to their Defence (ie 5--25%).

Every pulse the wielder is engaged in Melee Combat, any weapon spells
of the opponent's within the wilder's front 3 hexes have a chance of
being Disrupted and removed.  Furthermore any _Magical_ bonus to Base
Chance and Damage of a Shaped Magic has a chance of being Disrupted
and will be nullified for as long as the opponent remains in the
wielder's font 3 hexes.  The chance of this Disruption occurring is
10% (+5% per Rank in Shield).

Weapon spells include Enchanting Weapon, Phantasm, Weapon of Cold,
Weapon of Flames, Self-immolation, Diamond Weapon, Light Sword, Shadow
Sword, Dark Sword, Spectral Weapon, Minor Creation, Mending, Spectral
Warrior, Runeweapon, Unbreakability and other spells the GM sees fit.

A Giant would treat it as a Buckler and would receive 4% per Rank of
Shield to their Defence (ie 4--20%).

## Short Sword

Rank 10 Weaponsmithed, +5% +1Dm, Silvered.

## Castle

Callas has gained a small keep in the Duchy of Verbobnoc.  The keep
has a central tower 60ft high and four small towers forty feet high,
two of which flank a gate house 20 feet broad.  The gate towers occupy
one corner of the keep and the main tower is in the corner farthest
from the gates.  The keep is grarrisoned by twenty regular soldiers
who are longbow specialists armoured in leather, four sergeants
(chain, longsword) and a captain (plate and longsword).  All have a
light war-horses and remount.  The staff of the keep number thirty
five, the walls are 70 feet between towers.  A 5 foot dry moat
surrounds the keep.  The area commands a radius of 12 miles and
services a population of 4,000.  The area is rich in fruit trees and
grains, a little iron ore and a stand of hardwoods, an oak forest
around two miles in diameter.  The keep fronts the main trade road in
Verbobnoc.

Income per sea after taxes, tithes and costs is 600 silver pennies.
The keep is sub-fifed from Duke James of Verbobnoc, a tolerent and
well meaning half-elven ruler.  Around 1,200 of the population are
gnomes an 800 dwarves.  The inhabintants are happy with their lot and
are trained to form a militia of unusual strengh and morale.

## Val Estate

- Count of Borderlay Manor
- Val Estate Ruins

Given your recent gift (of 100,000 SP) to the Count, the Count of
Borderlay has invested Lady Callas Verdicini and Verdicini family of
her line with the ruin estates of Val a 4,600 acres holdings outside
the small Valyere town in northeast Borderlay close to County of
Borovia border, about 5 miles away from the edge of the local forts.

As of Blossom 817 WK - your estates have 135 families living there at
this time.  Rumours of missing locals, underground ruins and dungeon,
persist to this day. Retaining staff members is said to be hard
because of the ghosts.

The house comes with; four stories being basement, ground, first
floor, & attic. The six staff members have bedrooms in the attic
level. All of the stable hands and groundsmen and woodcutter have a
small cottage in the lower garden.

The manor house is large but old with two ruined mills and six bridges
which have been knocked out since the Drow took Borovia.  The area is
rich in food and has a copper mine in the hills to the north and same
rumours of Faye living in a wood that locals call the Enchanted Woods.

## The Oerth Stone

This chip of rock is in fact a piece of the Oerth Stone, a stone
intimately connected to the foundation of Oearth itself.  As such it
is of interest to many mages on Oerth and many inhabitants of the
Elemental Plane of Earth.  The has a variety of powers, some effective
in the hands of anyone, others usable only by Earth Mages and cratures
of the Plane of Earth.

### General Powers

Protection from Earth Elementals
: Elementals will not willingly approach with 50 feet of the wearer.
This protection is forgone if the wearer attacks, approaches or
attempts to charm or dominate the elemental.

Adaption
: The caster may exist and move through the Elemental Plane of Earth
without effect.  But seeing where they are going is still a problem.

Sense Gems
: The caster sense gems over 100sp value in a 10 foot radius if they
concentrate for two pulse.

### Greater Powers

Commune
: Prior to any adventure an Earth mage may ask ten Yes/No questions of
a general nature about the adventure they will be going on, provided
the questions in some way relate to the earth or concern creatures
that are in contact with, or stand upon or live within the earth.  As
stated previously, all questions must be a Yes or No nature.  If an
event relates to the future or events the GM can't answer then the
answer is "can't say / improssible to tell".

Multi-Planar Adaption
: The gem confers additonal adaption in the Quasi-Material Planes of
Gems, Magma, Dust and Silt.  Gems in a Quasi Plan where Radiance
touches Earth; Magma is where Fire touches Earth; Silt is the boundary
between Water and Earth and Dust is the boundary between the Negative
Material and Earth.

Craft Soul Gems
: Using the Oerth Stone an Earth Mage who is also Rank 8 in Gems work,
may craft a soul gem.  The cost is a point of Endurance and takes 2d10
weeks to complete.  The gem used must be a diamond of at least 10,000
sp value.  A Soul Gem may be used as part of a Trap the Soul Ritual by
an Earth Mage, Necromancer, Dark Mage, Wiccan or Enchanter.

Turn Elemental
: The Earth mage may Banish an Earth Elemental with the same chance
success as their Summon elemental chance.  This is a cast action,
requires the Oerth Stone to be presented to the elemental, but does
not cost fatigue or a pass action to prepare.  If failure occurs the
mage may not banish the elemental in question until they have further
ranked their Summoning ritual.  Attempting to turn an elemental
negates the protection value vs that elemental the Oerth Stone
normally gives.

Summoning Elementals
: Increases control and summoning chances by 1% per 2 full ranks or
fraction there of.  In addition, once per week the Earth Mage may
attempt to summon a Greater Elemental.  These Elementals are +2 points
per rank of additional strength, fatigue and andurance above those the
mage could normally summon.  These greate elementals are always
friendly to the Summoner and will never turn on them unless attacked
or injured by the Earth Mage in question (attacked includes using the
elemental as a fatigue or endurance source).  They resist banishing at
-20%.

Wall of Stone and Tunneling
: All effects increased by 50% for size, duration, area of effect etc.
If an Earth Mage is Rank 20 in both spells, all effects are doubled.


See Through Stone Talent
: The Oerth Stone may teach this Talent.  It may not be further taught
or invested.  Range is 2 feet + 1 foot per Rank.  Allows the Earth
Mage to see through stone and earth.  Oddly enough a light source is
needed by the mage for this talent to function and is stopped by iron.
EM is 250.

Troll Guard
: Thrice per week the earth mage may sprinkle soil or pebbles on the
ground to summon a troll guard (this is a fire action).  Each troll
guard summoned has endurance 40 and fatigue of 40 and a strength
of 30.  All other stats are as per the Summoner.  The troll may not be
used as a source of material components or as a sink for casting of
stroll skins or similar.  The troll(s) last 1 round per troll skin
rank of the summoner, regenerate both their fatigue and endurance back
at the rate of 1 point per round and attack for 2d10 + 6 points of
damgae, 2 attacks per round.  Srike chance is 70% normally and 100% in
close.  If a troll hits with both limbs it may bite for an additional
2d10 + 10 points of damage.  The trolls may be banished, never stray
more than 1 foot per Trollskin range from their Summoner and will
never turn on them.

Immunity to Petrification
: Just that.

Crystal Tears
: Tears from an Earth Mage in possession of the Oerth Stone may
sometimes manifest themsleves as 100sp gems.  Only tears generated by
genuine joy or sorrow may thus be manifest themselves and never more
often than once per day.  Attempts to stimulate this ability
e.g. onions, result in the Oerth Stone being lost to the users.
Crystal Tears generated by genuine joy or sorrow may be dissolved in
Holy Water to form potions of Love or Remorse.  A potion of Love
inspires fellowship, tolerenace and liking in the drinker for d10
hours.  A potion of Forgetfulness makes the character sorrowful,
maudlin and remorseful for d10 hours.  During this time the drinker
will attempt to atone for any evil they have committed.

Elemental Swarm
: Once per decade the Oerth Stone may call forth an Elemental Swarm.
The elementals summoned arrive in d20 minutes and the VERY angry at
all concerned (including the summoner) and highly destructive.  One
uncontrolled elemental arrives for each summong rank of the caster and
they arrive at the rate of one every thirty seconds after the first.
All these elementals have endurance, fatigue and strength of 100.  All
other stats are as per the caster.  Fortunately the elementals have no
idea who summoned them and simply go to work berserkly flatterning the
surrounding countryside.  They show a preference for detroying
structures of stone first, e.g. castles or stone bridges, or
underground complexes, but anything will do at a pinch.  The
elementals stay for 10 minutes per rank for the caster.

Essense of the Mountain
: The Oerth Stone provides knowledge ofthe Earth particularly in
Mountainous and Underground settings.  Mountainous, hilly and
underground terrain as level surface for the posessor of the Stone,
including walking over steep and broken surfaces up to 90 degrees and
taking no penalty to TMR or movement rate.


### Trap the Soul Ritual

Taught by the Oerth Stone.  May be further taught to Earth Mages,
Wiccans, Necromancers, Dark Mages, Enchanters.

EM
: 600

Cast Time
: 24 hours - 1 hour per rank

Base Chance
: 20% + Willpower + 3% / Rank - (target's willpower + resistances)

Resistance
: Passive

Range
: 100 yards per Rank

Both target and caster must be in contact with the ground for this
ritual to work.  The target's Willpower plus any resistances they have
reduce the base chance of success.  If the ritual is successful the
target's soul is drawn forth fromn their body and into the gem.  If
the ritual fails the gem is shattered and can never be repaired.  A
caster may use this ritual on themsleves to hide or store their soul.
Provided no one else finds the soul this is fine.  If they are found
then they are subject to the whim of the new owner and must obey their
commands without hesitation.  A body not currently posssessed of a soul
makes all checks vs possesion or domination at +30%.  If the Oerth
Stone is used by a mage as part of this ritual, resistance is based on
a subtraction for raw Willpower alone.  The target must be personally
known (ie met in person) for this ritual to work.


## Rank 11 Sabre

Teaching of one unique ability to Rank 11.  This ability may be
possessed by no other until irrevocable death occurs.  Time containts
still apply for training.  This can include weapon Ranks.

## A set of Meseemer's Plaques

These plaques (five in number) come in a carved ivory box.  The
plaques must be in the hand to have an effect.  The plaques are:

The Fool.  When presented at a critical moment the Fool steps out of
the card as if prepared to juggle.  The Fool then catches a magical or
missile attack directed at its owner and manifests this as catching a
juggling ball.  The attack may now be tossed back atthe ttacker
(grenado roll required) or the ball may be kept by the Fool.  The Fool
Plaque may be used up to four times and may store up to four balls.  A
fifth use ofthe Fool released all the remianing balls and the Fool
disappears in a flourish of entertaining waves and bows.

The Artist.  This plaue is blank but when drawn conjures a collection
of tiny paint pots, inks and pens.  The plaque then folds out as a
paint board with holders for the above.  The owner of  the plague may
then paint or draw into existane nay simple non livign non metal
object e.g. a door, window, stairwell, lap etc. no larger than 10 × 10
× 10 feet in size.  The plaque contains enough paints for a dozen
drawings [now 11].

Gorgeous Companion.  When drawn a companion of the appropriate sex and
race steps forth from the card, dressed for the correct social
occasion.  The Gorgeous Compansion is treated as a Rank 10 troubadour,
spy and courtesan/courtier and is an expert at lip reading, memroy
etc., reading all details expertly.  The gorgeous Companion has a PB
equal to that of the drawer +5 subject to racial maximums.  The
Companion is an expert at converstaion and after circulating for about
30 minutes will glean all there is to know from any particular social
event.  The companion then whispers the information in the owner's ear
while making other suitable social comments.  There is a 1/10 chance
per use the Companion goes their own way at any event and never
returns.  Someone else may then find the card and may queestion the
companion about their previous owner.  The plaque has no current
infomration on Lorefakir. [Gone].

Deferring Butler.  A Butler complete with tails steps forth and from
the card to intercept anyone approaching the plaque's owner.  The
Butler has an 10ft _Aura of Calm Disposition_, which calrms those
hostile to their master (save vs 2× Willpower or become non-hostile).
The Deferring Butler may then produce an acceptable explanation to the
Carlmed character as to why their master cannot be disturbed at this
moment.  This deferral may last up to twenty minutes.  This effect is
broken when combat actually commences whereupon the Butler steps
behind his master and offers useful observation and encouragement eg
"Bravo Sir!" or "Oh, I say, Good Shot Sir!".  The Butler will also
hold the character's equipment, jacket, etc.  The Butler retains
employment with this master for as many encounters as twice the
character's combined ranks of Courtier and Social Status.  The Butler
then seeks employment elsewhere.  Encourgement by the Butler
temporarily increases Willpower by 3 for the duration of the
encounter.  [Used twice].

Monologue.  A character using this cad can stay action (including
combat) for as long as they can effectively speak (save vs 1 ×
Willpower).  Villains and enemies will listen as long as the player
can describe why they, the character, are important, why the enemy is
(or isn't) and why they are destined to win (or not) etc.  The
conversation must be relevant in some way to the enemy (GM's call).
Fighting beings again as soon as the Monologue ceases.  Players may
use this time to heal etc (so can the enemy) but cannot ttack or the
Monologue is broken.  This card is destroyed when the talker is caught
contradicton any part of their earlier monologue (unless they are
particularly verbally agile) unless the result is humourous (GM's
call).

## The Wild Hunt of the Moon

Then the characters return to Alusia they each find around their necks
a locket in the shape of a *Hunters Moon*.  Stored within this locket
is an aspect of the *Wild Hunt of the Moon*, a last gift from the
Lady.  This locket may only be used once per Chase of the Moon
(thirteen years) and may effect up to one person for each and every
Ranger, Warrior and Weapon Rank possessed by the locket's owner.

When grasped and invoked under a moonlit night sky, those affected
take on the aspect of the Wild Hunt of the Moon.  TMR becomes tripled
and tireless and is unaffect by terrain - over water, through trees,
over hills, cliffs and dales, its all the same to the Hunt.  Movement
rate becomaes based upon the hights TMR in the party and mounts may be
included if desired to enchance movement (but mounts must be fully
grown stags, horses, wolves or dogs - all are treated as maximum sized
medium war horses for the duration of the Hunt).  A single mount per
rider does not count against the total number of creatures that may be
included in the Hunt.  This TMR effect fails under flying magics.  As
stated, the Hunt is tireless and relentless, not requiring rest and
incurring no fatigue penalty until the next dawn breaks.

Other Effects.  All those effected by The Wild Hunt are enamoured of
the Moon and may band damage in to their moon shadows for as long as
the Hunt is in existance - roll d10 for damage that may be ignored
from any particular blow of source.  Once again this effect also
applies to the Hunter's mounts.

All edges, thrusting or missile weapons in the hands of those affected
by The Wild Hunt of the Moon are blessed as if by a Rank 20 Weapon of
Darkness for as long as the Hunt exists.  Unlike Weapon of Darkness
**all** creatures may be affected by the blessed weapons.  The
Blessing effect lasts as loog as the weapon is dropped, broken, fired
etc but any new weapon grasped by a Hunt member becomes similarly
blessed.  Blessed weapons appear spectral, thin and silvery to sight.

Characters caught up in the Wild Hunt of the Moon have their DB
[Defense Bonus] increased by 20 for the duration and roll 3d10, not
d10, for all initiative rolls.  Members of the Hunt radiate Fear but
only one check is required by those meetng the Hunt on any particular
night.  Death results from Fear do not apply.

The Wild Hunt of the Moon has one additional effect:  If the total
number of possible participants in the Hunt is not filled, those
meeting the Hunt may be compelled to join it (save at 2 × Willpower)
or willingly join the Hunt.  Those who join the Hunt gain its benefits
but are subject to the will of the Master of the Hunt and will not act
against them.  If a member of the Hunter is also Favoured by the Lady
or may Draw Down the Moon they automatically gain a Hound of the
largest size as a companion and guardian.  The Hound does not count
against the total number of creatures included in the Hunt, may only
be affected by magical weapons, has an Endurance, Strength and Fatigue
of 30 and a TMR and other statis equal to its master.  Its DB is 50
and damge is 2d10+5.  The Hounds appear as flowing spectral froms with
green lambert eyes and tongues.

Other Notes.  The Hunt may not enter buildings, venture underground,
or enter or cross sanctified ground.  The Hunt may take to the sky as
if riding on solid ground.  The Hunt must be raised with a particular
objective in mind, e.g. scour evil from the land of Shawl this night;
or slay the ogre of Tyre.  When this objective is obtained the Hunt
fades as if dawn had come.

## Giant Spider Carapace

This is the black, chitin exoskeleton of a giant trapdoor spider.  An
armourer may use this to craft one suite of non-metallic, magical
plate armour at the cost of 5000sp, which will provide one less
protection than its metal equivalent but be half the weight.  In
addition the wearer will be unable to be ensnared in any web.  The
armour will be shiny black and will have a somewhat arachnid
appearance. [Heavy Plate, 8pt armour, 24 lbs].

## Eyes of Crystal Vision

Callas' eyes have been replaced with Saphires with gold irises.  This
enables her to have sharp, crystal clear vison, able to see though
obsurement up to 150 feet (as per the Illusion Enchanced Vision
Talent), and distinguish features as if they were a tenth of the
distance.

Should these eyes be removed from her body they will dissolve into
tiny shards of worthless value.  These eyes can be regrown by a Rank
10 Healer as per vital organs will not be affected by her dying and
being resurrected.

## Snake Armour

An image of a single red serpent is wrapped around the breatplate of
this learth armour.  Weight: 3, Protect 7, AG, -1.

The wearer receives a bonus of +20% to resist any control/charm (or
similar) spells.  In additon their PB is boosted by 4 (not above
racial maximum).

## Hero of Seagate

Description
: This Character was part of the party which for no profit killed the
child eating giant troll of Seagate harbour.  Normally this amy have
been overlooked by any but a few of the witnesses, however it was
witnesssed by a troupe of bards travelling through Seagate at the time
and they created a play with the names of the participants included in
the story.  This play is very good (Rank 9) and will be played in
various forms throughout the Western Kingdom.

The Play
: Callas is portrayed as a beautiful princess, mage and champion of
the light who calls upon the very forces of nature itself, summong
dozens of thousand foot elementals who do battle with the evil giant
troll as tall as the clouds.

The Good Side
: Anyone who recognises this character as the member in the play will
have their reactions appropriately adjusted as the mass of public
opionon is that this character is a hero.  This will orverride any
antipathy towrds the Adventurers Guild of Seagate with Callas being
judged upon her mertis alone, not those of the Guild as a whole.  No
Assassins Guild will accept a contract on this character as killing
heroes is bad for business due to the inevitable harsh crackdown and
public antipathy.  Independant assassins may be warned off by the
regular guilds also.

The Bad Side
: The character will be expected to be heroic, behaving in a cowardly,
evil or non heroic manner will cause people to seriously question the
heroic status of the character and may result in modifications to the
play in future years with this character becoming a dark villain or
coward.  Future GMs should feel free to change how this character is
portrayed to the public if their behaviour warrents.

## Paragon of Female Beauty

Callas had been blessed as a paragon of beauty.  This effects acts as
a Rank 5 Charm spell on males should they fail a saving throw at -15%.

## Flame Tattoo

Callas has a tattoo of a line of flames aroun her torso just above her
naval.  The flames are magically real and flamelike so are quite
realistic, but shed no light / heat etc.

This tatoo will remain unless the area is destroyed.

## Strength of Stone

Callas may cast her Strength of Stone on herself.  However, her spell
may only affect PS or EN when cast herself.

## Strength of Stone

Carzon, Lord of Oz, has modified the Strength of Stone spell for
Callas.  The spell has been changed so that the Ranks can be
distributed over Strength and/or Endurance at the discretion of the
receiver of the spell at the time of casting.  So, if Callas has Rank
15 in SoS, the the receiver of the a casting can chose to have 15
Strength, 15 Endurance, or a combination, such as 5 Strength and 10
Endurance, which totals to the full Rank.

In addition, Gayalette, Good Witch of the South, has added her own
twiste to the spell change.  When casting on self, Callas may spread
her Ranks across Willpower as well as Strength and/or Endurance.  This
represents the Earth Mages ground in the solidity and immovability of
earth.

This change is a gift to Callas for services rendered and is a
permanent change.  This spell may still be taught by Callas, but will
not include the modifications.

## Invested Crystal

Powers
: The crystal can hold up to ten charges of investment, not necessarily
all of the same spell.  Each charge is "stored" in one face of the
gem.

: All the requiremetns for the Inveestment Ritual must be met, except
that a psell can be invested in this item regardless of what is
already invested in the item.

Investing a spell in a face requires sucessful cast of the Investment
ritual, with all the costs that requires.

Value
: In itself, the crystal is worth 500sp.  Invested spells will add value.

Description
: A high quality colourless crystal, as big as two clenched fists, rough
cut over most its surface, with 10 cuts faces.  Each face is carved
with tiny runes in Ancient Quatarran script.

: The crystal weights 8 oz.  Like any gemstone, it is quite hard but
brittle.  It will not burn in normal fire.

Aura
: Magical, nature of magic is storage, plane of origin is Alusia.

## Dainty Diary

The render must study this book for two weeks and expend 500ep to
learn a Courtier specialisation as if the reader was already Rank 10.

## Bonus Rank in Unarmed Combat

Callas has defeated herself at the Temple of War and had gained an
additional Rank in Unarmed Combat (ie she may Rank Unarmed to Rank 11
[EP cost: 4000]).

## Lifetime Guild Membership

These members are now very respected and well liked in the eyes of the
Guild.  They are exempt from all Guild taxes.  The guild is in many
ways indebted tothem and its employees and representatives will always
be nice to them.  Guild employees may find themselves peeling potatoes
if their service to them is substandard.  Generally the guild will
extend services tothem when thees services cost the guild nothing to
itself, i.e. translation, the odd Shadow Wings, maybe an astrology
reading now and then, etc.

## Changes of Trollskin Spell

Carzon, Lord of Oz, has modifed the Trollskin Spell for Callas.  The
range has been changed to 10 feet (+5 feet / Rank).

This change is a gift to Callas for services rendererd and is a
permanent change.  The spell may still be taught by Callas, but will
not include the modified range.

## Blending

Callas may cast her Blending Spell on objects as well as Entities.
The object becomes concealed in the environment, not invisible,
e.g. Callas casts Blending on a Wall of Stone that she has created.
The wall fades into the background and appear to be a natural part of
the envrionment, an outcrop of rocks.  The spell has *camouflaged* the
wall.  Blending things carried by Entities lose the benfit of the
spell, unless the bearer remains still, in which cse the object
becomes concealed on their person.

This version of the spell will not hide hings that are glaringly
obvious (fire, pools of water, etc) but will conceal her Wall spells,
even inside structures.

This can only be cast on objects smaller than 10ft (+ 1 per Rank of
the Blending Spell) over its greatest dimension.

Normal Witchsight chances obtain.

## Wall of Stone

Callas may add or subtract up to one foot per Rank from the height or
length of her Wall of Stone Spell, to a minimum of one foot.

## Fatigue Limit

Callas may increase her Fatigue stat by one point per season, provided
she adventured in that season, at the cost of 2500EP.  They may exceed
racial maximums.

## Sapphire Heart

Callas' heart has been replaced with an enormous sapphire, in fact a
Great Sapphire.  She may cast when not in contact with the ground,
taking a minus 20 to her Base Chances.  She is also immune to the
Specific Grievous result that penetrates the heart.

Her rechangable ring of Enchance Enchantment had been set into her new
heart.  The spell now has a range of self, with no area of effect.

## Blessed by Moonlight

The Lady has blessed the character such that the next irrevocable
death the character experiences results in their re-incarnation at the
place of the moon power of the character's choice.  This effect is at
the player's discretion but may not be activated by suicide.

## Drawing Down of the Moon

Female characters are gifted with a vial of moon-silver which may be
used to Draw Down the Moon.  This power enables the character to
invoke the name of the lady once per season under the full moon.  The
vial will then fill with Monlight which may be drunk or stored as a
potion.  The potion may be Fertility - effects females only, Love -
effects males only with respect to females; Shadow Walking - effects
all, Skyclad - effect females only; or a Horned blessing - effects all

Fertility is as per a Wiccan Rank 10 *Fertility* but PB is also

rising of the next full moon.

Love is a per the Wiccan rank 10 *Love Philtre* and the name of the
one to be loved may also be embedded in the potion.

and makes character purified until the rising of the next moon.

Horned Blessing marks the drink as under the Hunter's Moon.  A Hunter
may pursue their prey without tiring over all terrains at double their
TMR for one hour per hightest ranked weapon, warrior or ranger skill.
The strike chance of the hunter is increased by 10 for the duration of
the effect, initiative is at +10 and dmage result an extra die being
rolled.

The Ritual of Drawing Down the Moon requires the vial, a full moon in
the night sky and fifteen minutes of prayer and quiet contemplation.

NB: Were-creatures will hesitate to attack the bearer of the vial - 3
× Willpower check required.

## Lunar Aspect

Characters are blessed with a Lunar Aspect during times of the full
moon.  They do not suffer from the ill effects of possesion of a Lunar
Aspect at other times.  Additionally they are Aspect Blessed for the
full nights of Samahain and Belataine.  This Aspect is not cumulative
with other effects - the best effect applies at the time.

## Moonsight

Characters may see as in full daylight if under the sky and when the
full moon is visible.

## Favour of the Lady

A lock of hair on a character's head becomes tinged with silver,
marking the character as having the favour of the lady.  All
were-creatures will hestitate to attack one favoured by the lady lest
her reath full upon them - 3 × willpower check required.  Additionally
all combats fought by male characters under the night sky, under a
full moon or while in dark foretss will result in the arrival of a
night creature to aid the character.  Creatures summoned will be of
normal creatures but of maximum size, un-naturally quiet - stealth of
130%, and will fight to the death to preserve th echracter's life.
Typical creatures are large owls, casts, hounds or wolves in urban or
rural environments are stags or large felines in the wild.  If a
character is dead or unconscious the creature will guard the body
until help arrives or the rising of the next moon.  The creature will
arrive in d10+1 pulses. [Not not apply to Callas].

Callas has been granted the Resist Pain Talent as a Racial Talent.
Shw has until 30th of July 1995 AP to archive Rank 6 in this Talent or
it will be lost.

Callas is more or less immune to pain.  For every 2 full Ranks in this
Talent +1 is added to the amount of effect damage required to Stun her
(ie. damage required must be greater than [EN / 3] + [Rank in Resist
Pain / 2].  At Rank 20 she will not be stunned no matter how much
effetive damage she receives.  Should she become stunned, 2 times Rank
in this Talents is added to the Base Chance of recovering from stun
(ie. the calculation becomes 2 × (WP + Rank in Reist Pain) + current
Fatigue.

Shw may add her Resist Pain to her Willpower for any calculation that
uses Willpower as a sistance to pain (eg. if shw were tortured).

  When the character travels about sith this key there is a good
  chance they will meet their one true love, or recognise each other

  to pass the key on.
  
  If they marry their one true love the character and their partner
  gain the following abilities.

     planar and infinite in range, this in practice allow each other

    other love based charming.

    that any other liaisons will be a pale shadow of what the

same species.  They will not be in love or happily married but may be
in an unhappy marriage, have parents which disapprove of the chracter

## Earth Door
Range
: Special

Duration
: One pulse

Experience Multiple
: 700

Base Chance
: 1%

Resist
: Passive only

Storage
: Potion

Target
: Self

This spell will transport the Adept and Rank / 3 other entities with
her up to 1 mile + 1 mile / 3 or fraction Ranks through the Earth.  At
Rank 20 the range is increased to 21 miles.  The Adept must be able to
see their hoped for destination or have previously visited or seen it.

The other entities must be in physical contact with the Adept and all
of the aspiring travellers must be in contact with the ground,
although they may be on, say, the second or third floor of a building
rooted in the earth.

Time to travel by Earth Door is one pulse.

This spell always Backfires on a roll of 100, regardless of Base Chance.
If the Adept wishes to travel to a point that she cannot see or has
never visited, then 30 is added to the die roll when she casts.

Should the spell backfire the result is entirely up to the GM.

## Golden Ring of Enchance Enchantment

This ornate golden ring has 4 Dragons intertwined with 4 emerald eyes
and is heavily inscribed with mystric symbols.  It contains 4 charges
of Rank 16 Enhance Enchantment.  Before triggering, the uesr must
state what is be Enchanced; Damage, Duration, Range or Base Chance.
The ring may be recharged by an Adept with Rank 16 or greater Enhance
Enchantment conducting a Rtiual Spell Preparation on the Ring (Minimum
of 1 hour and 2 Fatigue).  Provided the Ritual (Base Chance is that of
the rechargers Enhance Enchantement +3% per hour) is successful the

required.  The Base Chance of triggering is always 121% (2x 18%, 3x
6%).  Duration 100 seconds.  Range 30 feet.

## Life Aspect

Callas is Life-Aspected, except that the die roll modifier is caused
by destroying Undead.  Destroying Lesser Undead subtracts 5 from die
rolls, destroying Greater Undead subtracts 10 from die rolls.  There
is no other die roll modifer as a rsult of this aspect, however the DM
may assign a penalty if they see fit.  This apsect reflects a
connection to a Power of Trust, Undead existence being a primal
deception of Life itself.

This aspect change does not replace any aspect other than Death
Aspect, this aspect being in addition.  Thus Callas might be aspected
Spring/Earth/Life.

Any other Life-Aspect effect is ove-ridden by this one, so they are
immune to the result of having a standard Life-Aspect infliced on
them.

Duration and range is an for Death-Aspect, the effects are not
cumulative, but the greatest modifier applies.

not immune to the effects of magical aging, each year over 70 reduces
all her primary and secondary by one, to racial minimum.

distance of 35 feet.  Each rank that she achieves with this talent
adds an extra 5 feet to this distance.

The Experience Multiple for this talent is 200.

: 5%

Exp. Mult
: 550

Resist
: Passive

Storage
: Trap, Ward

Target
: Substantials entities of flesh or plant matter

Effects
: Range ignores the elevation of the target.  Ranage is calculated
  from the Adept to the target along the ground.

This spell changes the target's flesh to stone, cuasing the target to
take damage and lose Agility.  This damge is [D − 2] + 2 / Rank and
the loss to Agility is 1 + 1 / 3 or fractions Ranks.  If the target
resists then they take half damage, rounding up, and half the Agility
loss, rounding up [Multihex creatures to a minimum of 10 AG].

Agility is regained at 1 point per hour after the next dawn.

Half the value of armour, rounding down, is subtracted from the damage
of the spell, but the full value of Natural Armour applies.

In addition, damage from this spell will only reudce the target to 0
Endurance, but should the targetr fail to resist, and their EN was or
becomes 0 or less, they are immediately petrified.  That is, their
body tissue and all their posessions are turned to a stone-like
substance.

Petrified entities are not dead, and they do not lose any magic
currently in effect, but run out when the duration expires.
concentration spells and effects will be lost.

Counterspell of the Petrification Spell, Curse Removal or Stone to
Flesh Ritual.

## Immunity to Fear

Callas is immune to fear effects from any source, including spells.
This doesn't apply to fear caused by Dragons, Demons and Powers,
whether they are pig ugly, have a special ability or they cast spells
to cause it.

## Incomparable Duelling Pair [Given to Sabastian]

This is a matched set of duelling blades, a Rapier and a Mains
Gauche.  They are of the highest quality and inlaid with an intricate
black adamantium filigree in the form of a long stemmed rose with its
thorned stalk wound round the blade ending at the pommel in the shape
of a rose flower in adamantium.  The blades are indestructible and
always sharp.  While wielding these blades in a duel they confer the
following benefits.

Rank 10 in both Rapier and Mains Gauche or one ligher than the
opponent, whichever is greater.

They never miss.  Roll to ttack as normal counting all misses as a
normal FT hit as long as hitting the target would be possible.  If a
drop or break fumble is rolled and the 3×MD check is not passwd the
blades will disappear, unwilling to be wielded by such an incompetent.

While evading, if an opponent missed and the wielder scores a riposte,
they will catch the opponents weapon with the Mains Gauche and break
it (assuming the opponent's weapon is of a reasonable size, i.e. not a
giatn weapon and it can actually be broken).

Bonus: If Sabastian wields these weapons in a duel, as his first
attack he can inflect the slashed cheek specific grievous on his
opponent automatically.

## Master-crafted Shield

This Large Round Shield has been superbly crafted by a Rank 14
Weaponsmith from Granite Peak dwarven hold so that it has no negative
modifier to MD when prepared.  It has been customized for Callas and
in anyone else's hands it will incur a penalty of -2 MD.  The shield
boss has been fashioned in the likeness of a stylised Dwarven face.

## Master-crafted Sabre

This trusilver Sabre has been superbly crafted by a Rank 15
Weaponsmiwth from Granite Peak dwarven hold to provide +14% SC.  It
has been customized for Callas and in anyone else's hands it will only
count as Rank 10 (+10% SC).  It is simply adorned with "Granite Peak
Hold" inlaid in mithril runes on the blade.

## Ben Wa's Spheres of Ecstasy

This is a pair of one and a half inch diameter, smooth, metal sphes in
a velvet drawsting pouch.  When employed in love making {veil of
decency lowers} they will allow the user to give a female partner the
most amaxing experience they have ever had, which will last up to 3
hours.  This exertion will cost both parties all of the FT (and then
some!).  If the user shows them to an unwilling or reluctant
prospetive (NPC) partner and makes an appropriate suggestion, the
target must make a 2 × WP check or succumb to the wiles of the user.
This will not remove all inhibitions from the target and they will
still have their usual morals.

Bonus: For Callas the sphers may be used on males partners {queue
another veil of decency} aswell as female ones and will effect up to 3
partners at once.  The experience will last up to 6 hours and Callas
only uses half her FT while her partner(s) will be spent.  Also, her
partners will try most acts within reason at her suggestion.

## Snake Dagger

This dagger has a snak twisted around the blade and enchanted to be
deadly in combat.  For every point the weilder reduce damage on the
next blow their dice roll is reduced by 1 (up to five points).  BC:
50% DM +4

## Storm Orb

This fragile orb carries the power of a storm.  When trigger electial
storm will appear for a pulse in a mega hex centered at any point
within 50ft of the caster.  All within the area suffer 2D damage
(resist for half, Air College). [4 charges].

## Death Mask

This is a golden death mask from Pharos.  Whil worn by a corpse it
preserves the body as the Healer ability of the same name with no
limit.  While a corpse wears the mask the body and its soul are immune
to all necromatntic magic and influence.  The mask weighs pounds and
is solid gold.

The mask also has a once only ability.  If the mask remains on a body
for a day or more, the next resurrection attemp on them will be
automatically successful and the person will be brought back to life
will no ill effects from the resurrection and will be fully
functioning immediately (this means they will not lose the point of
Endurance from dying).  They will also be fully cured of all curses
include death curses. [Not used].

## Sabre of the Silent Depths

This sabre has a pitch-black blade that seems to absorb light.  It is
a reforge of several magical swords into one, created by the Granite
Peak dwarf hold weaponsmiths.  It has also been infused with black
mushroom essence, further enhancing the anti-magic properties of the
original weapons.

The weapon was broken and repaired and is now brittle.  It it is
broken again the weapon will be damaged beyond repair.

BC: 70% DM: +5 Class: B IV: +10

It has the following abilities.

1. The chance of scoring an Endurance blow while wielding this sword is 20%.
2. Against creatures of the deep earth (excluding dwarves) it does an
   additional +5 damage that ignores armour.
3. Any entity struck by the weapon will have a random beneficial spell
   in effect on them dissipated unless they resist vs Namer college.
4. Weapon spells may be cast on it and they may be stored for up to a
   day until activated with a trigger action.  Weapon of Diamond may
   be stored indefinitely.

Material
: Chalk, paint, blood, cornmeal, ink or other symbol making materials

Actions
: Chanting and inscribing symbols

Concentration Check
: Standard

Effects
: This Ritual seals an area, structure or wall against entities from
the elemental planes. The Adept must know the name of the planes, and
the name of the plane that the Adept is currently occupying cannot be
used. No entity whose plane of origin has been sealed against can
voluntarily enter the sealed area. They will be stopped at the
boundary as is all their Talent, Spell and Ritual Magic. Any entity
taken into the area against their will (or without their knowledge,
e.g. unconscious) will attempt to leave the area as quickly as
possible. If an attempt is made to summon an entity from the named
plane into the area the summoning will fail. Any entities from the
named plane that are inside the area when the sealing is created are
unaffected, but should they leave the area they will be unable to
reenter it.

Non-namers can learn and rank it as a ritual. They may attempt to
perform it quickly but each 10-minute reduction reduces the Base
Chance by 6% to a minimum of 10 minutes and 70%.

Namers can learn and rank it as a spell. They may attempt to perform
it quickly but each 10-minute reduction reduces the Base Chance by 2%

## Falling Leaves

Each of these leaves was harvested and dried by Gayalette, Good Witch
of the North on Oz, and imbued with special power. When crushed and
infused in hot water, one helping of a brown tea can be made. The
drinker of this tea will be completely immune to all forms of damage
and effects from Earth, or Earth based magics, for a period of one
season (13 weeks).

This includes, but is not limited to:

*	Falling great distances to land on earth or stone
*	Being hit by an Earth Elemental
*	Being grabbed by a Hand of Earth
*	Being crushed by a boulder. Though they may be trapped, they will not be crushed.
*	Being hit by any weapon made of stone or earth.

The leaves will last indefinitely till used.

## I See You

This small disc shaped crystal is 3cm diameter and 3mm thick. It has a
small hole through it near the edge, so can be worn on a necklace,
wristband, or such.

The crystal has been worked by the Wicked Witch of the West (WoW) on
Oz to show when the wearer is being magically scryed. The crystal is
normally a deep azure in colour. This colour will immediately change
to deep magenta when the wearer is scryed magically.

This includes, but is not limited to:

*	Telepathy or Empathy
*	Wizards Eye
*	Crystal of Vision
*	Waters of Vision
*	Detect Aura

The crystal will slowly fade back to its normal colour over a period
of 1 minute once the source of magical scrying has gone.

The crystal looks somewhat fragile, but is nigh on unbreakable by
normal means.

## The Rose of Little Thorn [gone]

In appearance this is a perfectly ordinary red rose with a 12" long
thorny stem, it has exquisite fragrance and is unblemished and would
be considered an almost perfect specimen.  For a year and a day it
will provide the benefits below, after which it will turn to ash
becoming non-magical.  It is however remarkably durable, and can
withstand damage similar to say a fired clay brick, then it will also
turn to ash and lose all powers.

Name may invoke one power per day (renews at dawn) by holding The Rose
and using a trigger action:

Fragrance of Tranquility 
: A single entity can be allowed to truly smell The Rose and will have
a fleeting vision of a peaceful city on a sunlit meadow, for some
reason this will be intensely calming and will negate almost all
extreme tendencies.  This will instantly cure effects such as Berserk
Rage, Hysteria, Phantasm (Mind S6) or other psychological influences
both natural and magical.  Most who smell the Fragrance of
Tranquility will be amiable (+25 reaction), or at least willing to
have dialogue, but usually have a wistful longing to find the city in
the vision ever after.

Coming of Spring
: A single non-sentient plant may be restored to exceptional vitality.
This will cure diseases, remove and make immune to parasites and
magically grow and repair any branches, leaves and flowers which would
normally occur for the season.  The effect lasts until the next winter
or a year and a day, whichever is first.

Nature's Calling
: Name may draw upon The Rose to enhance their horticultural
abilities.  When held throughout a spell, ritual or ability they may
double their effective rank (no maximum).  This will only enhance
non-hostile effects, so would not work if say Healing (Earth G-6)
could damage an undead creature, despite usually being considered a
non-hostile spell.  Suitable things to double include Earth G2, G6,
G10, S8 (see caveats), Wica S1 and S19, appropriate Alchemist,
Herbalist and Artisan skills.  If the total time to enact the ability
exceeds the new dawn rising it will fail.

Necessity of Pain
: Name may transform The Rose into a two-handed sword.  It will revert
back to The Rose each dawn, but if broken will turn to ash and lose
all magical properties.  The blade is wooden and may have a weapon
spell cast upon it.


Thorn Blade:

Wt	PS	MD	SC	    DM		Class	Use	
--  --- --- --- ----------  ------  ---
5	11	14	75	2D10 + 10	A & B	 M

The Long Sorrow
: Name may invoke resistance to poisons.  By drawing the thorns across
their flesh to create a bloody gash and holding The Rose in the wound,
causing 1EN damage and 1 point bleeder thereafter, they will become
immune to all poisons, venoms or other blood toxins.  They will stop
bleeding and the effects will cease once The Rose is removed, they
have bleed out all their FT and EN to 0 or dawn rises.

## Ambran Sash

Description
: Thin silk sash, about 4 feet long, about 6 inches wide.  It is a
  pale grey colour (but see below).

Powers
: The ash gives its possessor +9 ranks in Ambran (but not literacy).
  I.e. someone who does not speak Ambran will have Rank 8.  This does
  not stack with any other language magic.  The possessor cannot teach
  the language.
: The Sash protects its possessor against magic that detects Aura or
  Aspect or like (e.g. Detect Aura).  The possessor is always actively
  resisting such magic (which will increase backfire chance where
  application).  If the possessor spends an action to actively resist
  the magic, they gain no extra bonus.  Any spells or items or other
  things that gives bonuses to MR will stack with this.  The sash only
  makes the wearer actively resist all such magic automatically.
: The sash colour coordinates itself.  It has a continual colour
  cantrip which can be changed and turned on or off at a mental
  command from the wearer.  This does not affect, and will will stack
  with, any illusion magic on the wearer.

Value
: 1,200 sp

Aura
: Magic, nature of magic communication and obscuring; plane of orgin Ambra.

Notes
: The sash is as fragile as a normal silk item (i.e. pretty tough).
  The strong weave means it will hold up to 50lbs weight.  Water has
  no effect on it.  It can be folded very small.  It will not rip
  under normal use, but can be cut.  If the sash is damaged, all
  enchantment is lost.
: The Dragon Court of Ambra is a very cosmopolitan place.  It is very
  likely that an entity who commonly travels planes has been there.
: The mage who created the item, Viersaunt, can see through the aura
  and aspect protection of the sash (i.e. he can DA through the sash).
  The same goes for dragons.
: Wearing two sashes does not double the powers - they don't stack
  with each other.

## Blade of Darkness

Plane of Origin
: Alusia

Nature of Magic
: Celestial

Physical Appearance
: This object is a finely crafted black tulwar, the hilt composed
  primarily of obsidian, rendered strong as steel, the blade of bound
  darkness.  The blade does not radiate darkness, but it is highly
  visible under light conditions.

Weight
: 2lbs

Effects
: The Blade of Darkness is amagic sword which was weaponsmithed prior
  to enchantment.  The total bonus is +10% to base chance and +2 to
  damage.  The primary magic in the blade is darkness.  On a
  successful strike, casuing effective damage, an opponent who fails
  to resist may be struck blind for D10 pulses if the wielder of the
  sword subtrcts a point of fatigue (or of endurance if they have no
  remainging fatigue).  This fatigue loss counts as spell fatigue.
  Even those entities who do not use eyes to see with can be "blinded"
  by this effect, with the result that they must subtract 40% from
  melee strike chances.

## Crystal of Vision

This is a standard Rank 6 Crystal of Vision.

## Leather Armour

Wgt
: 18 lbs

Prot
: 5

AG Mod
: 0

Stealth Mod
: 0

Value
: 2200 sp

This suite of finely crafted hard leather armour has been
armour-smithed to provide no Agility Modifier and an etra point of
Protection.  It is sized to fix a 5'10" to 6'2" human male.  It would
take a Rank 10 armour-smith 4 hours (and cost 55sp) to adjust the fit.

## Main Gauche

This Rank 4 Weaponsmith Main Gauche has +1 damage.

## Mana Potion [Used]

This potion, when imbibed, allows general knowledge spells to be cast
with less strain on the adept.  When ever a general knowledge spell is
cast, there is a chance the fatigue cost will be reduced by one.

Chance = 90 - (Adepts total ranks in Special knowledge spells)%

The duration of this effect is twenty four hours.

## Mana Tear

This looks and feels like a teardrop of obsidian about one and a half
inches long and one inch in diameter at the largest point.  The
material is less brittle than obsidian, but quite as resilient as
iron.  When DA'ed, the Tear is "formerly living", Generitc True Name:
three-quarter devil, and from the 8th Plane of Hell.  The tear is able
to store one spell of up to Rank 10 for up to 1 week.  To store a
spell, an Adept must successfully cast a spell at the tear.  If the
cast roll is "00" then the tear is destroyed.  The the cast is a
double or triple effect then only a normal effect is stored.  The tear
is "triggered" to release the spell effect, with a trigger Base Chance
of 75%.  If the triggering roll fails and is not a "00" then the spell
effect is still stored, and the trigger may be reattempted.  If the
roll is "00" then spell spell effect stored is lost.

## Obsidian Amulet

This amulet of extremely hard, black stone, on a silver chain, seems
to absorb all light coming into contact with it.  It is a piece of
darkness elemental, and must be worn against the skin to have any
effect.  While worn by a Celestial Dark Mage they will gain a minimum
Lightting Dondition Modifier of +5, and will always be in the presence
of elemental darkness.  Conversely, if worn by a Celestial Solar Mage
they will gain a maximum Lighting Condition Modifier of -5.

The amulet will absorb 1/2 (round down) of all damage the wearer
receives from Walls of Starlight, Light Swords, Bolts of Starfire,
Webs of Light, and Solar Flames.  But should the amulet absorb 10 or
more points in one pulse it will explode, and in so doing inflect D10
damage directly to the wearer's Endurance.

This amulet may be banished as per Namer Banishing in conjunction with a
Celestail Special Counterspell.

Powers
: The wearer has a 20% reaction bonus from anyone friendly to the
  Children of the Traveller, if the item is visible.

: The wearer has increased taste and spell.  All perception rolls
  involving taste or smell are one step easier (e.g. a 3xPC check is

  one greater.  If they are unranked then they can track as a Rank 0

  Ranger.

: The wearer has a bonus of 6% to their Stealth skill.

## Pearl of Waterbreathing

This object looks like an ordinary pearl, but instead is a receptable
for a Water Breathing spell.  The pearl has to be placed near the
wearer's skin in order to function.  Currently the pearl is empty.
When a Water Mage holds the pearl and casts a WaterBreathing, the
spell is immediately absorbed by the pearl and split into a number of
charges equal to the number of hours that the spell would normally
run.  Each charge lasts for an hour and has a base chance of 45% +
3/rank of spell initially installed.  The pearl can only be recharged
when it is empty.  If a backfire occurs when charging there is a 5% *
spellrank chance that the pearl will crack and be rendered useless.
As a safety feature, if the current charge runs out while the user is
still underwater the next charge, if present, automatically activates.
The user will be aware that this occurs.

Currently [Spring 821WK] it has 13 charges with 90% BC.

## Pact to the Outer Power Hades

### Hades

Hades is a deity of lawful neutral alignment whose sphere is Death. He
rules over an underworld plane named Hades which includes realms such
as Tartarus and the Elysium Fields. He is fair and just, but stern and
capable of very harsh decisions. His symbol is is the ram's head. His
avatar normally appears as a large, dark-skinned man with a black
beard and fiery eyes.

### Divine Intervention

Hades can be called upon through prayer. A reaction roll should be
made to determine the deity's response, which may be modified by the
character's recent actions.

### Benefits

1.  A character pacted to Hades becomes Death aspected if the
character is not already Death aspected.

2.  A character pacted to Hades receives a rankable talent in all
respects similar to the Speak with Dead talent of the College of
Necromantic magics.

3.  A character pacted to Hades receives a special ability called the
Kiss of Death through which the character may bring instant death to
an entity on negative endurance through an appropriate touch. Using
this ability requires two full actions, one to make contact and the
second to sever the target's life.

### Costs

1.  Should a character pacted to Hades die resurrectably there is a
-20% to the chance of successful resurrection in addition to the
normal penalty for death aspect.

2.  Should a character pacted to Hades die resurrectably the character
will have to argue eloquently with Hades for their soul to be
permitted to be returned to the mortal plane. If the GM wishes, this
may be played out with the GM acting as Hades.

3.  A character pacted to Hades is expected to serve Death in all its
aspects. That character cannot ever learn to resurrect the dead or
learn necromancy. The character is expected to bring merciful death to
his or enemies quickly and expeditiously. The state of undeath is
anathema to Hades and the undead are to be brought to their true Death
summarily, even at the risk of the character's own life.

Ishmael willingly entered into this pact in the City of Kersoon on
Thunor on 15 Fruit 798.
