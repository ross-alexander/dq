\section{Restrictions}

This magic is restricted to members of the Secretariat and can
be cast anywhere.

\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Concealed Casting}
\multiple{150}
\begin{effects}
This Talent allows the Adept to cast without any apparent movement or
noise.  The Adept may not speak or make meaningful or extravagant
actions. They may not cast without a hand free or if mute.  If an
observer is intent on the Adept (e.g. in conversation with), the
observer may make a (2 × PC) - Rank check to notice. All aspects of
the Spell (including Base Chance) must be cast at the lower of the
Talent’s and Spell’s ranks, and the Base Chance is further reduced by
20\%. The Talent only functions with spells of the College of
Illusions.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Detect Enchantment}

\range{30 feet (+ 5 / Rank)}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{PC + 3\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
This talent determines whether an item, person, or area in
line-of-sight and within range is currently under an enchantment or
magical effect.  The Adept can tell whether the enchantment is a
current spell or ritual, a warded, invested, or permanent effect, is
contained in a trap or is a curse.  A double effect will reveal the
general nature of the spell (eg. defensive, summoning, damaging) and
the effective Rank or remaining duration of the enchantment.  In
addition, a triple effect will tell the Adept the exact name of the
magic (eg. Wall of Bones, Hellfire), or the College of the spell.

Once the initial, most recent, magical effect has been successfully
detected, older enchantments on a target with multiple layers of magic
may also be detected.  This may be continued while the Adept continues
to succeed in detecting Enchantments.  However, only one attempt per
quarter may be made to detect any given enchantment.  If a new
enchantment occurs, the Adept may attempt to detect it, though this in
no way affects the status of the old layer.  If an old, unsuccessfully
detected enchantment expires, the Adept may attempt to detect any
newly revealed magic beneath it.

If the Adept is in contact with the target then the base chance of
this talent is improved to PC + 5\% / Rank.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\section{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Evil Eye}

\range{Self}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Magical Trap, Investment}
\target{Entity }
\begin{effects}
When the adept casts Evil Eye on themself, a third eye appears in
their forehead, which is normally invisible but is able to be seen by
Witchsight and similar effects.  When the adept is under the effect of
the Evil Eye all spells they cast on others are resisted at a penalty
of Rank unless the target is wearing an Amulet of Elder Flowers.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[G-2]{Telekinesis}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
Allows the Adept to lift a target of weight up to 2 pounds and move it
at the rate of 2 TMR.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{ESP}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can sense the presence and general mood (but not the exact
nature) of all entities within range of the spell.  The Adept has a
general idea of where each entity is, say to within 90 or 60 degrees,
the accuracy of which may increase with rank.  ESP will detect the
presence of an entity even if that entity is mind cloaked. Spells
cannot be targeted through ESP.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}
