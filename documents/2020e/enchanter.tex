\begin{College}[1.1]{enchanter}{Ensorcelments \& Enchantments}{EN}

This College is concerned with general magic, but especially with
charming and enchanting individuals and objects.  Practitioners of
this college are often knows an Enchanters.


\section{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Ensorcelments and Enchantments may practice
their arts without restriction.

The MA requirement for this College is 16. 


\section{Base Chance Modifiers}

There are no modifiers to the Base Chance of performing any talent,
spell, or ritual of the College except as listed in magic modifiers or
under the descriptions of the specific spells, talents, and rituals of
the College.


\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Wizardsight}

\multiple{150}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see objects or entities that are invisible — they appear
to have a slight blue sheen around them.  If the invisibility effect
(excluding Walking Unseen) is of a higher Rank than the Wizardsight,
the object or entity may not be clearly identified or directly
magically targeted.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}


\section{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Charming}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may influence the actions of any one entity by casting a
Spell of Charming over the individual. If the Generic True Name is
known, the Base Chance is increased by 15. If the Individual True Name
is known and used, the Base Chance is increased by 25.

The victim of the spell will then see the caster as their true friend
and will readily accept most suggestions emanating from them.  Sworn
enemies of the caster (or of their race) will not be affected by this
spell unless the victim’s Individual True Name is spoken and, even
then, the duration of the spell is halved.

The caster may either suggest actions to the victim or may order them
to act in a certain way on pain of losing the caster’s “friendship”.
Any suggestion that is not directly and obviously inimical to the
victim’s interests (as defined by the GM, but usually limited to
actions that would be injurious or fatal to the victim) will be acted
upon 90\% of the time.  The caster may only ensure 100\% compliance
with a request by making it an order based upon the friendship that
binds the victim and caster together.  In such instances, however, the
victim immediately makes a Resistance Check.  If they resist, then the
spell is broken.  Otherwise, the victim will accept the order and be
100\% faithful to it for the remainder of the spell.

Whenever any suggestion is made that would lead to the victim’s injury
or death, another Resistance Check is made.  If the check is
unsuccessful, the victim will accept the suggestion, otherwise the
spell will be broken.

For each Rank of the spell the Adept may move an additional 5 pounds
or increase the speed by an additional 3 TMR.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Telekinesis}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
Allows the Adept to lift a target of weight up to 2 pounds and move it
at the rate of 2 TMR.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Enchanted Sleep}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may send the target, provided it normally spends any time
sleeping, into a deep enchanted sleep which will last for the duration
of the spell or until the entity is awoken by another entity (by being
shaken, etc.).  The target may not be wakened if the spell is Rank 10
or higher, but must continue to sleep until the spell wears off. If a
General Knowledge counterspell of this college is cast upon an
affected target by any Adept then the spell will immediately dissipate
and the target can then be woken normally.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Walking Unseen}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  This
means that it will not transmit light. As a consequence the target
will cast a shadow (which may or may not be noticed depending on the
lighting etc — even if noticed may not be connected to the target) and
have a reflection in a mirror (or any reflective surface).  However
the target may not be noticed even if another entity is looking
directly at him/her.  It should be noted that a crystal of vision or
similar would count as looking directly at the target, not as a
reflection.  An entity will get a perception check if the target
becomes invasive on that entity’s senses (e.g. standing in a frontal
adjacent hex, or standing behind the entity with the target’s hands
over his/her eyes). Although the target is not invisible, it may be
detected using any magical means for detecting invisible entities
(e.g. witchsight).

If the target of the spell is touched by another entity, or that
entity’s possessions, then the spell is broken.  The target of the
spell may not break it voluntarily (other than by, for example,
touching another entity).  Once broken the spell must be recast.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Speaking to Enchanted Creatures}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell gives the Adept the ability to speak and understand the
language of all magical creatures.  One casting will allow
communication with any fantastical creature, but will not allow the
Adept to comprehend fantastical creatures talking amongst themselves
or to other people affected by this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Location}

\range{10 miles + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may determine the direction in which they will find any
person or object of their desire which they have previously
encountered or studied and which is within range.  The direction will
be indicated by a large glowing arrow, only visible to the Adept.  The
arrow will not appear if the target is not within range. If cast, and
the target is not within range, then the spell is dissipated. The
arrow will not appear should the target come within range during the
period the spell would normally have been in effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Mass Charming}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{850}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Charms 1 entity per Rank as long as the Adept maintains their
concentration.  The spell takes 3 minutes to take effect and the
effects linger 3 to 5 minutes after concentration is broken.

The effects of the spell on the individuals are identical to the
effects of Spell of Charming [G-1].
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Invisibility}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{45\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
The target becomes invisible.  Unless cast at rank 16 or higher, the
spell ceases whenever the target makes a strike check in melee or
close (whether successful or not). The target may choose to end the
spell at any time.

An invisible thing does not have a shadow or reflection but is still
affected by light (e.g.  may still see, be sunburned, be blinded by
Flash of Light, damaged by Solar Flare etc.).

The possessions of the target are also invisible. An object’s
possessions are anything that is totally enclosed by that object (e.g.
coins in an invisible chest which is closed, but not one which is
open).  If a thing ceases to be a possession, then it is no longer
invisible.  Similarly if an object becomes a possession then the spell
will affect it (i.e.  an object put down by an invisible entity will
become seen; a coin put in the invisible chest will become invisible).
Note that light may not be a possession — if the target is carrying a
lantern it will be invisible, but the light it emits will not.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Evil Eye}

\range{Self}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Magical Trap, Investment}
\target{Entity }
\begin{effects}
When the adept casts Evil Eye on themself, a third eye appears in
their forehead, which is normally invisible but is able to be seen by
Witchsight and similar effects.  When the adept is under the effect of
the Evil Eye all spells they cast on others are resisted at a penalty
of Rank unless the target is wearing an Amulet of Elder Flowers.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\section{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Greater Enchantment}

\duration{Special}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{80\% + 1\% / Rank}
\target{Entity}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{Black Myrrh (optional)}
\materialcost{200 sp per oz used}
\begin{effects}
The ritual takes 1 hour and requires that the Adept first draw a
Pentacle within which they and the target(s) must remain during the
entire ritual. The Adept may burn black myrrh during the ritual to
enhance the effects.  The target of this ritual will be either blessed
or cursed (Adept’s choice) with an increase or decrease in their Base
Chance of doing anything or suffering any good or ill fortune by plus
or minus 1 + (1 / Rank).

The ritual will affect the target’s fortune in one of 
the following areas:  

• Resistance — Magic Resistance, Fear, Fright \& Awe Checks.

• Magic — Talent, Spell, and Ritual Base Chances.

• Combat — Weapon Strike Chances and Stun Recovery.

• Skills and Statistic Checks — Skill Base Chances and General
Statistic Checks (e.g.  1 × PC or 4 × AG).

The default duration is until the next end-of-season High Holiday.
This will enhance one of the above areas.

The Adept may alternatively cast a form of the ritual that will affect
5 targets for 1 day (plus 1 day OR 1 target per 4 full ranks).  This
will enhance two of the above areas.

To increase the number of areas affected, the Adept may burn (1 oz ×
Ritual Rank) Black Myrhh per additional area.

If the ritual is used to curse, the curse is minor.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Creating Crystal of Vision}

\multiple{200}
\basechance{75\% + 1\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can create a crystal that acts as a viewing crystal.  They
perform the ritual over an available piece of crystal (the bigger the
crystal, the better the image will ultimately be) in their possession.
The Adept must burn 1 ounce of ambergris during the ritual at a cost
of 1,000 Silver Pennies.  The resulting crystal may be used once per
day for 10 minutes + 1 minute per Rank (GMs should carefully time
consultations).

They may then view visions (usually precognitive in nature) concocted
by the GM.  At Rank 6 and above, they may use the crystal to spy into
an area to see what is going on there.  The maximum distance from the
character to the area being spied into is 5 miles (+ 15 / Rank). To do
so, the Adept must remain in the same place and take no other action.

If a crystal ball is used to look at a location then the ball will
only look at the location specified.  It cannot then be commanded to
move around. It will enable the observation of events in that location
for its duration and will then clear. Once started, it will continue
to look at that location for its entire duration.  If the user cannot
form a clear mental image for the ball to focus on, or command it to
focus on an unambiguously defined point in space, then it is the GM’s
discretion as to what the ball will show.  These are mystical devices,
not telescopes or x-ray machines. It is not possible to use detection
talents (such as Detect Aura) through a crystal of vision.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-3]{Creating Sleep Dust}

\multiple{250}
\basechance{80\% + 1\% / Rank}
\casttime{3 hours}
\begin{effects}
The Adept must spend 3 hours preparing and implementing this ritual
and must expend 10,000 Silver Pennies (500 / Rank) to purchase the
necessary ingredients prior to making the attempt.  If the attempt
fails, the ingredients are ruined and may not be reused or resold. If
the ritual succeeds, one ounce (a single dose) of sleep dust results.

When thrown in the face of one target it has the effect of an instant
Spell of Enchanted Sleep of the same Rank as the sleep dust.  The
sleep dust will only remain fresh for three weeks after manufacture.

The effects of sleep dust can be passively resisted by the victim, but
with a reduction of 20 to their Magic Resistance.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-4]{Manufacturing Poison Dust}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{80\% + 1\% / Rank}
\casttime{3 hours}
\begin{effects}
This ritual works in the same manner as Q-3 and employs the same
numbers for all purposes.  However, instead of causing the victim to
fall asleep, it inflicts [D - 5] + 1 for every 2 (or fraction) ranks
damage due to poisoning, on individuals who fail to resist.  Like
sleep dust, poison dust must be thrown in the face of the target.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}


\section{Special Knowledge Spells}


\begin{spell}[S-1]{Ventriloquism}
\range{90 feet}
\duration{5 minutes + 3 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The spell allows the Adept to project their voice and alter it so that
it sounds like any other voice the Adept has heard. The voice may be
projected so that it appears to be emanating from anywhere within the
radius of the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Bolt of Energy}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cast a bolt of energy at a target and will, as a result,
inflict [D - 5] (+ 1 per Rank) damage on the first entity or object
that the bolt encounters.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Opening}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Ranks}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
Instantly opens any one object or portal, including those locked by
Mage Lock (S-6).  A door or lid will have all locks unlocked and bolts
undone and will become immediately open (ajar).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Enchant Weapon}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
Increases the Base Chance to hit with the weapon over which it is cast
by 1 (+ 1 / Rank) and increases the damage done by the weapon by 1 for
every 3 (or fraction) Ranks.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Web of Entanglement}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration:  maximum  15  minutes  + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the Adept to project a sticky web, similar to a
spider web in construction, from their fingertips at a target hex,
object or entity.  Any objects or entities standing between the Adept
and the target are ensnared by the web along with the target. The web
may only ensnare a number of human-sized entities equal to the Adept’s
rank and so will stop at the hex at which this limit is reached (or
maximum range).

The web continues until cut or until the Adept ceases to concentrate
on it. In order to cut the web, a character must successfully strike
with a weapon that does type B damage and must inflict at least 10
points of damage as a result of that single strike.  The web has no
defence.

Any ensnared entity must roll 1 × PS (2 × PS if they successfully
resisted) in order to move themselves to an adjacent hex (which may
be free of the web), or to perform an action within the web.  A
similar check is required for any entity attempting to remove an
object from the web.  If an entity receives aid in removing themselves
from the web, the PS of the aiding character may be combined with
their own.  Any dropped object will become ensnared by the web, as
will any entity who comes into contact with it (up to the limit of the
web).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Mage Lock}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The spell may be cast over any portal (door, window, etc.)  that can
normally be opened or closed.  It effectively locks the portal with an
unpickable lock.  The portal may still be forced open by brute
strength.  The Physical Strength(s) of all characters attempting to
force a portal locked in this manner are added together and multiplied
by the Difficulty Factor of the task.  The Difficulty Factor is a
function of the Rank of the spell:
\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{4em}X}}
Rank	& Difficulty Factor \\
1--5	& 3 \\
6--10	& 2 \\ 
11--20	& 1.5 \\
\end{dqtblr}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Enhancing Enchantment}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Rank of this spell is added to the Rank of one characteristic of
any spell being cast within the area of effect. Note that the actual
Rank of the affected spell is unchanged --- only the effect of one
characteristic is enhanced (as per double and triple effects).

While casting the Spell of Enhancing Enchantment, the adept specifies
the spell characteristic to be affected.  Only Range, Duration, Base
Chance, or (where appropriate) Damage, may be affected by this spell.

A spell may never have a characteristic enhanced by Ranks greater than
its own rank by the use of this spell (e.g. a Rank 6 spell that is
cast within a Rank 8 Spell of Enhancing Enchantment will only gain the
effects of 6 extra ranks in the affected characteristic).

Only spells that are cast are affected, not spells being released from
any form of storage.  The caster of the subject spell will be aware
that their spell is being affected by enhancement during the pulse
that they are preparing (as per high or low Mana). They will not know
which characteristic is being affected nor the amount of enhancement.
They may not restrict the effect of the enhancement, but may reduce
the spell effects in the normal manner. If an attempt is made to
cast a Spell of Enhancing Enchantment on an area that has some part of
it under the effects of another Spell of Enhancing Enchantment, then
the second spell will fail.

Special Duration, Range, or Damage effects may be caused by the use of
this spell (e.g. Duration of Lesser Enchantment at Rank 20).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Levitation}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes × [D - 5] × [Rank]}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Causes the target of the spell to rise into the air 15 feet (+ 1 /
Rank) at the rate of 1 foot / pulse.  The spell is limited to vertical
movement and will in no way propel the target horizontally.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Enchant Armour}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Ward, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell adds 2 (+ 2 / Rank) to the target’s defence versus physical
weapons.  At Rank 11 and above it also permits the target’s armour to
absorb 1 additional point of damage.  The target must be armoured.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Wizard’s Eye}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an invisible, intangible eye which they can move
around within a radius equal to the spell’s range. The eye originates
in the same spot as the Adept and operates as would any normal eye
except that it is not attached to the Adept physically.  Wizard’s Eyes
have a TMR of 10.

The eye can move through solid objects but will see only blackness
while within an object. The eye can be seen with witchsight or other
means of detecting invisible objects. It is possible to use the eye to
target spells, but the range is determined from the Adept, not from
the eye.  The eye (and hence the Adept) is susceptible to magical
effects if the effect can affect eyes (e.g.  Flash of Light,
blindness).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Slowness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds × [D - 5] × [Rank]}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell affects 1 (+ 1 / 2, or fraction, Rank) targets.  All
entities subject to this spell have their running, crawling, flying,
or swimming speed halved and have the time it takes them to do
anything on the Tactical Display doubled (e.g.  they could only attack
once every two pulses).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Quickness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds × [D - 5] × [Rank]}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell affects 1 (+ 1 / 3, or fraction, Ranks) targets.  The
targets’ Initiative Value is increased by 10, and they can perform
Actions twice as often.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}
