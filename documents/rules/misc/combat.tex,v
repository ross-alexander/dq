\begin{multicols*}{3}
% \section{Introduction to Combat}

Individual Combat is an inevitable and sometimes necessary occurrence,
and characters should be aware of its dangers. Fighting is a deadly
process and should be avoided if at all possible. Heroes are made by
defeating the dragon, but more graves are dug than heroes made. The
DragonQuest combat system reflects these dangers and emphasises skills
and smarts over brawn and brutality.

When combat has begun, the players should place the figures
representing their characters on the Tactical Display, with the GM
determining their final position. The hostile figures are placed by
the GM, and the Combat Sequence begins.

Combat time on the Tactical Display is divided into five second Pulses
during which all figures may attempt to take an action, depending on
their position relative to hostile figures. The order in which these
actions take place is determined by the figures' engaged or unengaged
Initiative values. Attacks are resolved by comparing the attacker's
Modified Strike Chance with a percentile roll. A successful hit does
D10 damage, plus any bonus for weapon type and skill.

When all figures on the Tactical Display are dead, unconscious,
incapacitated, or friendly to each other, the combat is
finished. Combat should never last longer than necessary to resolve
the situation; returning to normal interactive role-playing will speed
overall play.

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{Description}
\item[Action] The movement and combat activity a figure may attempt during
one pulse.

\item[Attacker] The figure performing the Action currently being resolved.

\item[Attack Zone] Any hex into which a figure may attack in Melee or at
Range.

\item[Base Chance] The base percentage chance of hitting with a weapon, as
listed in the Weapon Chart (\S\ref{tables:weapons}).

\item[Blocked Hex] A hex which contains enough solid material to block any
attack. A Blocked Hex is never part of an Attack Zone.

\item[in Close] A figure in the same hex as a hostile figure is in Close
with the opponent.

\item[Damage Check] A roll on a D10 to determine the amount of damage
done after a successful hit. This roll is modified by the weapon, the
Rank or Physical Strength of the wielder, circumstances and magic.

\item[Damage Points] The number of points of damage done as a result of a
damage check.

\item[Defence] The amount that a target may subtract from an Attacker's
Strike Chance, determined by Modified Agility, a shield, magic and
conditions.

\item[Effective Damage] Any Damage Points (to either Fatigue or Endurance)
that are actually inflicted on the figure hit after allowing for
absorption due to armour or magic.

\item[Engaged] A figure who is in the Melee Zone of an opponent, or is in
Close, is engaged.

\item[Engagement] A group of adjacent figures, all of who are engaged with
each other.

\item[Facing] A figure must be unambiguously oriented towards one hex
side. This determines their Front and Rear Hexes, and Attack
Zone. They may change facing during any Action unless specifically
prohibited.

\item[Figure] Any entity or combatant occupying the Tactical Display.

\item[Grapple] An attack in Close Combat.

\item[Grievous Injury] An injury that results in specific damage to a body
part.

\item[Hex] A 5 foot diameter hexagonal area, with sufficient room for a figure
to fight in Melee.

\item[Initiative] Engaged Initiative determines the order of individual
actions within an Engagement. Unengaged Initiative determines the
order in which entire sides of Unengaged figures act.

\item[Line of Fire] A straight line drawn from the centre of an Attacker's
hex to a target's hex that is in the Attacker's Ranged Zone.

\item[Melee Zone] The front hexes of any conscious, unstunned, standing or
kneeling figure armed with a prepared weapon rated for Melee combat.

\item[Modified Agility] A figure's Agility after it has been modified
due to weight carried (see \S \ref{tables:encumbrance}), armour worn (see
\S \ref{tables:armour}) and circumstance.

\item[Modified Manual Dexterity] A figure's Manual Dexterity after it
has been modified due to the type of shield carried (see \S
\ref{tables:shields}) and circumstance.

\item[Modified Strike Chance] The percentile chance to successfully
hit a target after the target's Defence and all Strike Chance
Modifiers (see \S \ref{tables:modifiers}) have been taken into
account.

\item[Obscured Hex] A hex which a figure cannot see into, but through which
objects may pass.

\item[Pass Action] Any preparatory Action that does not directly affect
another figure and is not otherwise covered by specific Actions.

\item[Prepared Item] Any item (weapon, shield, flask, etc.) that a figure
has in their hands and may immediately use.

\item[Pulse] A five second period of game time that regulates Actions on the
Tactical Display.

\item[Ranged Zone] The hexes radiating out from a figure's front hexes into
which that figure may see and fire a missile weapon.

\item[Sheltered Hex] A hex which contains enough solid material for a target
to shelter behind such that approximately half of their body is
protected from any attack.

\item[Strike] Any Action that attempts to hit a figure.

\item[Strike Chance] The standard percentage chance of hitting with a
weapon; it is a combination of Base Chance, Manual Dexterity, Rank and
magic.

\item[Strike Check] The percentile roll against an Attacker's Modified
Strike Chance to see if a Strike was successful.

\item[Stun] A figure who takes sufficient Effective Damage in a single blow
is Stunned, and may not attempt to perform any acton except Recover
from Stun (see \S\ref{combat:stun}).

\item[Tactical Display] The area to which a combat is confined; assumed to
be covered with a grid of hexes.

\item[Tactical Movement Rate (TMR)] The maximum num\-ber of hexes that a
figure may move in a single action, determined by Modified Agility and
Race.

\item[Target] The figure on the receiving end of any Attacker's action.

\item[Unengaged] A figure who is not adjacent to an opponent, or who is not
in an opponent's melee zone and chooses to be unengaged.

\item[Weapon] Any item used to Strike a figure.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Preparation for Combat}

\subsubsection{Paperwork}

Character Sheets for all combatants should be prepared before the
combat. These contain information that will be used continuously
during combat, such as Strike Chances, Initiatives, Movement Rates,
etc. A player is responsible for ensuring the completeness and
accuracy of the information on their Character Sheet, while the GM
should prepare this information for all NPCs in advance. Any damage or
other losses in combat should be recorded as the combat
proceeds. Percentile dice and copies of all charts and tables should
be available for ready usage. Lead figures or counters for all
combatants should also be available, as these add to the clarity and
excitement of a combat.

\subsubsection{Surprise}

One side in a combat may gain a free pulse of activity if it surprises
the other. If one side in a combat is unaware of either the
opposition's intent or their location, they are surprised unless the
figure with the highest effective Perception succeeds in making a
Perception Check. This Perception check is modified by both Ranger
Detect Ambush and the Sense Danger Talent.

Prior to placing any figures on the Tactical Display, the GM should
determine whether surprise exists. If one side is surprised, they
should place their figures in a way that represents their lack of
readiness. If no surprise exists, the players may place their figures
as they choose, then the GM places the opposing figures, with the GM
having the final say on all placements. As a guideline, if there is
surprise, the distance between the two parties should not exceed 8
hexes, while if there is no surprise, the distance should not be less
than 8 hexes.

If surprise exists, the party with the advantage may have a free pulse
of activity without the surprised party being able to respond;
otherwise, the normal Combat Sequence starts.

\subsubsection{Fatigue}

After placing all the figures on the Tactical Display the GM must
assign any Fatigue losses the figures may have incurred as a result of
their actions prior to combat. For player characters, this should have
been recorded as they slept, rested, travelled, cast magic or
attempted other fatiguing actions. For all NPCs, the GM should make a
quick estimate relating all presumed activity they may have undertaken
up to the start of combat.

\subsection{Combat Sequence}

The order in which all actions are attempted in a pulse is called the
Combat Sequence. This sequence should be adhered to at all times as
this will greatly speed play. Each pulse, events occur in the
following order:

\begin{Enumerate}
\item Unengaged Initiative is determined for each side.

\item If any figures are engaged or in Close, these figures are
grouped into Engagements, and each Engagement is dealt with
separately.

\item In each Engagement, engaged Initiative is determined, and then
the figures act in order of Initiative (highest to lowest), each
performing one Action from the Engaged Actions list.

\item The winner of the unengaged Initiative now resolves the Actions
(selected from the Unengaged Actions List) of all their unengaged
figures, in any order they choose. All their actions must be resolved
before any figures on the opposing side may act.

\item Remaining unengaged figures may act as in Step 4.

\item
End of Pulse activity occurs. This may include an additional stun
recovery attempt for figures that were Stunned during the Pulse and
any housekeeping.

\end{Enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exceptions to the Combat Sequence}

\begin{Description}

\item[Engaged Figures becoming Unengaged] If a figure becomes
unengaged before their engaged Action is resolved, they must act on
their unengaged Initiative. If they become unengaged after they have
had their engaged Action, they do not gain an extra Action.

\item[Unengaged Figures becoming Engaged] If a figure becomes engaged
before their unengaged Action is resolved, they must select an engaged
Action on their unengaged Initiative.

\item[Optionally Engaged Figures] A figure who is adjacent to a
hostile figure, but is not in any opponent's Melee Zone, may choose
whether to be treated as engaged or unengaged, and acts on the
appropriate Initiative.

\item[Extraordinarily Agile Figures] A figure who has a modified
Agility of 26 or more may perform two Actions on their
initiative. Their choice of Actions is restricted. See \S
\ref{combat:restrictions}.

\item[Stunned Figures] If a figure is Stunned before their Action, they
may attempt to Recover from Stun as their Action.  This takes place
when specified for Stunned figures in the Initiative Section below.
If a figure is Stunned during the Pulse they may attempt to Recover
from Stun at the end of the Pulse in which they were Stunned, regardless
of whether they acted or not.

\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Initiative}
\label{combat:initiative}
\begin{Description}
\item[Engaged Initiative] A figure's engaged Initiative Value is their
modified Agility + Perception + their Rank with prepared weapon +
Warrior bonus. If the figure has no prepared weapon, they may use
their Unarmed Rank. Any ties indicate simultaneous combat. In each
Engagement, figures with faster initiative may choose to act after
figures with lower initiative, but all engaged Actions must be
resolved before any unengaged Actions. If an engaged figure is not in
any opponent's Melee Zone, they may act first in the engagement. If a
figure is Stunned they act last in their Engagement.

\item[Unengaged Initiative] A side's unengaged Initiative is their
leader's Perception + D10. If the leader is a Military Scientist, they
gain a bonus to this roll. Any ties are re-rolled. The leader may
choose to have their entire party act after a slower side. This
decision is made before any engaged actions are resolved. If a side's
leader is engaged, Stunned or otherwise incapacitated at this point,
another character may assume this role.  All figures who are under a
single Leader take their Actions in the same Initiative, in any order
that they find convenient.  A Stunned figure always acts last in their
side.

\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Action Timing}

When a figure chooses an Action, they are assumed to be performing
that Action until they start a new action or are stunned. However, any
Action which requires a dice roll to resolve is completed when that
dice roll is made; the figure is assumed to be engaged in follow-up
manoeuvres until their next action.  After successfully recovering
from Stun, a figure is assumed to have just finished a Pass Action
until their next Action, for all purposes, and any previously prepared
shield or weapons are once again prepared.

\subsubsection{GM Conventions}

These are only conventions; the GM may modify these conventions to
suit their own style.
\begin{Description}
\item[Announcements of Intent] When combat occurs on the Tactical
Display, there should be no lapses of time between player
announcements of character intentions and resolution of them. When it
is a character's turn to take action, the player must announce within
5 seconds what their character will do, or the character will take a
Pass Action. The GM should restrict themselves to a similar guideline
for their NPCs. A player may change the action they announced for
their character to a Pass Action (only) up to five seconds after they
announce it.

\item[Discussions during Combat] If the players wish to discuss
tactics amongst themselves, they must do so quietly while the GM is
determining the result of a particular action. Anything said by one
character to another during combat may be overheard. A Military
Scientist character may allow a party a Time-out during which they
will not be overheard.

\item[Rule Clarification] Any player may, at the GM's discretion,
suspend the passage of time by requesting a clarification of a
relevant point by the GM. They may also appeal a decision made by the
GM that they feel to be arbitrarily or improperly resolved. The player
has as much time as the GM may grant. The GM may modify or reverse
their decision, or stand behind it. The GM's word is always law.
\end{Description}

\subsection{Engaged Actions}
\label{combat:engaged}

Being engaged imposes certain limitations on the actions that a figure
may attempt. The primary restriction is that an engaged figure may not
move out of the Melee Zone of an opponent except in special
circumstances. If an engaged figure is in Close Combat, their range of
Actions is further restricted.

The order in which the Actions of engaged figures is resolved is
determined by each figure's engaged Initiative.

\subsubsection{Melee Attack}

An engaged figure may move one hex and change facing, and then attempt
a Melee Attack. They may not move after they have attacked.

\subsubsection{Close \& Grapple}

An engaged figure may attempt to Close \& Grapple. If the Attacker is
within the Melee Zone of the target, they may try to Repulse the
Attacker's attempt to Close by rolling less than or equal to their
prepared Melee weapon Rank on a D10. Multi-hex figures may not be
Repulsed, but the defending figure may avoid the attack by succeeding
in a 1 \x AG check.

A successful Repulse means that the target has interposed their weapon
between themselves and the Attacker, and the action has failed. If the
Repulse is unsuccessful, the Attacker may go into Close and make a
normal Grapple attack.

\subsubsection{Evade}

An engaged figure may move one hex and change facing while executing
an Evade. If a Melee Attack is attempted on a figure who is Evading
with a Ranked weapon, they may be able to Parry the attack. An Evading
figure receives a bonus to Defence versus Melee and Ranged Attacks.

\subsubsection{Offensive Withdraw}

An engaged figure may make a Melee Attack with a -20 penalty to their
Strike Chance. They may then move one hex and change facing. They may
freely leave the Melee Zone of any opponent, but may not move into
that opponent's rear hex.

\subsubsection{Defensive Withdraw}

An engaged figure may solely defend, increasing their defence by
20. They may then move one hex and change facing. They may freely
leave the Melee Zone of any opponent, but may not move into that
opponent's rear hex.

\subsubsection{Flee}

An engaged figure who does not have an opponent in their Melee Zone
may Flee. This allows them the same options as an unengaged Move. Any
opponent able to Melee attack the figure automatically receives
Initiative.

\subsubsection{Pass}

An engaged figure may move one hex and change facing while performing
a Pass Action.

\subsubsection{Cast}

An engaged figure may change facing but not move while attempting to
Cast a Spell. Casting is a Magical Action. Like all other actions,
Casting is resolved on the figure's initiative.

\subsubsection{Throw}

An engaged figure may change facing but not move while attempting to
Throw a weapon. They may only Throw into their Ranged Zone where they
have a Line of Fire.

\subsubsection{Recover from Stun}

An engaged figure who is stunned may attempt to recover from Stun.
They may not make any movement or change facing.

\subsubsection{Leaving Melee Combat}

A figure engaged in Melee Combat may only leave Melee Combat by (i)
executing a Close \& Grapple; (ii) executing a Withdraw or Flee; or
(iii) by stunning or otherwise incapacitating all opponents who have
the figure in their Melee Zones. Other Actions may never take the
figure out of any hostile Melee Zone.

\subsection{Close Combat Actions}
\label{combat:close}

All figures in Close Combat are treated as engaged. However, while in
Close, only close-rated weapons may be employed. All other weapons or
items must be dropped immediately. Figures in Close Combat are treated
as prone, and thus have no Melee Zone or facing.

If an engaged figure is in Close Combat, their Action is limited to
one of the following:

\subsubsection{Grapple}

A figure engaged in Close Combat may neither move nor change facing
while attempting a Grapple. A Grapple is an attack with any
close-rated weapon (including Unarmed).

\subsubsection{Withdraw from Close}

A figure may attempt to Withdraw from Close Combat. If they are
successful, they may move one hex, but are still treated as prone. A
figure may Withdraw from Close if a D10 roll plus any positive
difference in total Physical Strength between the friendly and hostile
figures in the hex is at least 10.

\subsubsection{Pass}

A figure engaged in Close Combat may neither move nor change facing
while taking a Pass Action. They may not attempt a Magical Pass Action
or Multi-Pulse Action. Some other Pass Actions will be impossible, as
they are effectively prone.

\subsubsection{Recover from Stun}

A figure engaged in Close Combat who is stunned may attempt to recover
from Stun as their Close Combat Action.

\subsubsection{Leaving Close Combat}

A figure engaged in Close Combat may leave Close Combat by (i)
executing a Withdraw from Close; or (ii) by stunning or otherwise
incapacitating all opponents who are in Close with the figure.

\subsection{Unengaged Actions}
\label{combat:unengaged}

An unengaged figure is one that is not engaged.

\subsubsection{Move}

An unengaged figure may move any number of hexes up to their
TMR. During movement, a figure may change facing as desired.

\subsubsection{Step \& Melee Attack}

An unengaged figure may move one hex and change facing, and then
attempt to Melee Attack. They may not move after they have attacked.

\subsubsection{Charge}

An unengaged figure may move up to 1/2 TMR and attempt to Melee Attack
with a non-pole weapon. At the end of the figure's movement, if there
is a hostile figure in the Attacker's Melee Zone, they may make a
Melee Attack with a -15 penalty to Strike Chance. The figure may not
change facing after the Melee Attack.

\subsubsection{Charge with Pole Weapon or Shield}

An unengaged figure may move up to TMR and attempt to Melee Attack
with a pole weapon or Shield. At the end of the figure's movement, if
there is a hostile figure in the Attacker's Melee Zone, they may make
a Melee Attack with a +20 bonus to Strike Chance. The figure must move
at least 2 hexes, and may not change facing after the Melee
Attack. This action may not be attempted with a Tower Shield or a Main
Gauche.

\subsubsection{Charge \& Close}

An unengaged figure may move up to 1/2 TMR and attempt to Close. If
the figure passes through the Melee Zone of the target, the target may
try to Repulse the figure in the same way as for a Close \& Grapple.

If the Repulse is successful, the target has interposed their weapon
between themselves and the Attacker. If the Attacker cannot or will
not stop entering Close, the target automatically inflicts a potential
Specific Grievous Injury on the Attacker.

If the Repulse is unsuccessful, the Attacker may go into Close, and
may attempt a normal Grapple action or a Trample attack.

\subsubsection{Evade}

An unengaged figure may move up to 1/2 TMR and change facing while
executing an Evade. If a Melee attack is attempted on a figure who is
Evading with a Ranked weapon, they may be able to Parry the attack. An
Evading figure receives a bonus to Defence versus Melee and Ranged
Attacks.

\subsubsection{Retreat}

An unengaged figure may Retreat, increasing their defence by 20. They
may move up to 2 hexes backwards and change facing.

\subsubsection{Pass}

An unengaged figure may move two hexes and change facing while
performing a Pass Action.

\subsubsection{Cast}

An unengaged figure may not move while attempting to Cast a Spell, but
may change facing. Like all other actions, Casting is resolved on the
figure's initiative. Casting is a Magical Action.

\subsubsection{Throw}

An unengaged figure may move up to 2 hexes and change facing while
attempting to Throw a weapon. They may only Throw into their Ranged
Zone where they have a Line of Fire.

\subsubsection{Fire}

An unengaged figure may not move while attempting to Fire a missile
weapon, but may change facing. Once a Crossbow is prepared and loaded,
a figure may carry it around and fire whenever they wish. In this
instance, the figure may move up to 2 hexes either before or after
firing. All missile weapons need to be Loaded before they may be
Fired. The figure may only Fire into their Ranged Zone where they have
a Line of Fire.

\subsubsection{Recover from Stun}

An unengaged figure who is stunned may attempt to recover from Stun.
They may not make any movement or change facing.

\subsection{Free Acts}
\label{combat:free}

In addition to their normal Action, a figure may always drop whatever
they have in their hands and, if not performing a Magical Action, they
may say a short phrase during their Action.

\subsection{Action Restrictions}
\label{combat:restrictions}
Movement may be restricted by terrain or other conditions. Figures
with a modified Agility of 8 or less may have their movement reduced
when performing other Actions, while those with a modified Agility of
22 or more may gain extra movement or Actions. Figures who become
stunned or otherwise incapacitated may not attempt normal Actions,
except that stunned figures may attempt to recover from Stun as their
Action.  The type of Action a figure may attempt is restricted by
their position on the Tactical Display, and their visibility. The use
of magic in combat is subject to restrictions, and may in some cases
be impossible.

\subsubsection{Movement}

Any complicated turning manoeuvre may result in a reduction in the
figure's movement allowance for that pulse. A reduction of 1 hex is
suggested for each 180$^{\circ}$ turn. At the end of the Action, the
figure must be unambiguously oriented towards one hex side.

A figure's movement allowance assumes a flat surface with little or no
hindrance to movement. Some terrain is not conductive to quick
traversal, and the figure should suffer a reduction to movement in
such conditions. A figure should normally be able to move at least 1
hex per pulse, no matter what the terrain.

If a figure enters the Melee Zone of any hostile figure, they become
engaged, and must stop movement, though they may change facing. If the
figure is performing a Charge \& Close, they may attempt to enter
Close, but the opponent's hex counts as a hex of movement.

If a figure wishes to jump during their movement, they should have
their movement allowance reduced, and the figure must make an Agility
Check to land cleanly.

Often two or more friendly figures will wish to pass through a hex at
the same time, or need to squeeze past each other in the same hex. The
GM should judge whether circumstances permit this, and if so, whether
the figures are hindered. If neither figure is endeavouring to do more
than move through the hex, there will usually be little problem, but
more dangerous manoeuvres may reduce movement or require Agility
Checks.

A figure may move backwards at half their movement rate, and crawl at
1/4 rate.

\subsubsection{Pass Actions}

A Pass Action is any generic non-attacking action a figure may attempt
which is not otherwise covered by specific Actions. Typical Pass
Actions include: preparing an item or weapon; putting an item away;
picking up a dropped item; mounting or dismounting a steed; loading a
missile weapon; drinking from a flask; dropping to one knee or prone;
rising up, etc.

Pass Actions also include Multi-Pulse Actions and the following
Magical Pass Actions: Prepare Spell; Actively Resist; Concentrate (see
\S \ref{magic:concentration}).

Typical Actions: The following list is intended as a guide for the GM
to be able to judge how many pulses an attempted Action will take to
perform.  Note that some Actions that figures in combat wish to
attempt will take far more than one pulse.

\hspace{1em}Other (see note L \S\ref{tables:weapons}) &  \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{Figures with Low Agility}

Figures with modified Agility of 8 or less are allowed one less hex of
movement when executing any of the following Actions: engaged Melee
Attack, engaged Evade, Retreat, Pass, Fire Crossbow, Throw.

\subsubsection{Figures with High Agility}

Figures with modified Agility of 22 through 25 are allowed one extra
hex of movement when executing any of the following Actions: Melee
Attack, engaged Evade, Withdraw, Retreat, Pass, Fire Crossbow, Throw.

\subsubsection{Figures with Extraordinary Agility}

Figures with a modified Agility of 26 or more may perform an
additional defensive withdraw, retreat or non-magical pass action
except when Stunned. The actions are resolved consecutively, in either
order. The figure's total movement may not exceed their TMR.

\subsubsection{Stunned Figures}
\label{combat:stun}

A figure who becomes Stunned may only take Recover from Stun as their
Action.  A figure who was Stunned during the Pulse gets an additional
attempt to Recover from Stun at the end of that Pulse.  They may still
take free Acts.  The Base Chance of Recovering from Stun is 2 \x WP +
current FT.  A stunned figure has no Melee Zone.

\subsubsection{Position of Opposing Figures}

The type of Action a figure may attempt is restricted by the position
of the nearest opposing figure. If a figure is in the same hex as a
hostile figure, they are in Close, and may only select an Action from
\S \ref{combat:close}. If a figure is in a hostile figure's Melee Zone
and is not in Close, they are engaged, and may only select an Action
from \S \ref{combat:engaged}. If a figure is not in a hostile figure's
Melee Zone, but has a target in their Melee Zone, they may select an
Action from either \S \ref{combat:engaged} or \S
\ref{combat:unengaged}, depending on how they wish to be
treated. Otherwise, a figure is unengaged, and must select an Action
from \S \ref{combat:unengaged}.

\subsubsection{Visibility}

If a figure is attempting to perform a Melee or Ranged Attack on a
hostile figure who occupies a hex that is obscured (due to smoke,
magic, etc.), they may be affected by visibility modifiers (see \S
\ref{tables:modifiers}). If they are attempting to cast a spell that
requires targeting, they must make a Perception Check. If the figure
is totally obscured, they are treated as invisible for Strike Chances,
and may not normally be targeted by a target: Entity spell. The GM
must determine if a figure is affected by an Area or Line of Fire
spell, or Ranged Attack.

\subsubsection{Disturbing Magical Actions}

If an Adept is performing a Magical Action, and is attacked, they must
make a Concentration Check (see \S \ref{magic:concentration}) or their
Action will fail. If the Adept is stunned or has sufficient cold iron
lodged within them, their Action will automatically fail. An Adept may
not cast while prone.

\subsubsection{Action Summary}

The Action Summary (\S \ref{tables:actions}) lists all valid Actions
and their Restrictions.

\subsection{Attacking}
\label{combat:attacking}

The order of all attacking Actions is determined by the Initiative
procedure as detailed in \S \ref{combat:initiative}. Combat involving
engaged figures is always resolved before any combat involving
unengaged figures. An attacker's weapon is always assumed to be held
in their primary hand unless stated otherwise. Empty bare hands are
always considered a prepared weapon.

A hostile figure may be attacked by Ranged, Melee or Close combat
while on the Tactical Display. Special types of attacks are allowed,
and these include Multi-hex Strikes, Multiple Weapon Strikes, and
attempting to Trip, Entangle, Restrain, Knockout, Shield Rush or
Disarm.

\subsubsection{Ranged Attacks}

A figure may attempt to attack a hostile figure in their Ranged Zone
via ranged combat by executing a Fire or Throw Action. The figure
declares their target, determines and applies any Ranged Combat
modifiers (see \S \ref{tables:modifiers}), and executes a Strike
Check.

To Fire a missile weapon, the figure must be armed with a prepared and
loaded missile weapon. To Throw a weapon, the figure must be armed
with a prepared weapon rated for ranged combat. The figure must have a
Line of Fire to the target. If the Line of Fire contains an obscured
hex, the figure may not Aim, and treats the target as if invisible.

Whenever the weapon enters a hex occupies by a figure or object (other
than a solid obstacle that the missile must hit), there is a chance
(as determined by the GM) that the weapon will hit the figure or
object instead of continuing its flight. This must be resolved for
each figure occupying any hex along the Line of Fire until the weapon
hits something or loses momentum and falls to the ground.

A figure cannot check a Line of Fire without executing an Aim, Fire or
Throw action, whether or not the weapon is actually loosed.

\begin{Description}
\item[Snapshooting] A figure with a prepared Short Bow, Long Bow,
Composite Bow, Giant Bow or Sling, with which they are at least Rank
3, may prepare an arrow or bullet and Fire in the same Action. The
Strike Chance is reduced by -15. Snapshooting is a Fire Action.

\item[Aiming] A figure with a prepared and loaded missile weapon may
choose to take a Pass Action to Aim the missile weapon at a particular
target. If the figure then Fires at that target in their next Action,
their Strike Chance is increased by +20, and in addition, the chances
of causing Endurance or Specific Grievous damage are increased to 20\%
and 10\% of the modified Strike Chance, respectively.
\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Melee Attacks}

A figure may attempt to Melee Attack any hostile figure who occupies
at least one hex of their Melee Zone. The figure declares their
target, determines and applies any Melee Combat modifiers (see \S
\ref{tables:modifiers}), and executes a Strike Check with a prepared
melee-rated weapon. The attacker may move adjacent to the target
during that pulse.

The normal Melee attack is intended to do as much damage to the target
as possible, but other forms of specialised attack exist.

\subsubsection{Close Combat Attacks}

A figure may attempt to attack any figure who occupies the same hex
via Close Combat by executing a Grapple Action. The figure declares
their target, determines and applies any Close Combat modifiers (see
\S \ref{tables:modifiers}), and executes a Strike Check with a
prepared close-rated weapon. The attacker may move into the target's
hex during the pulse; this is known as closing.

\subsubsection{Attacking into Combat}

A Ranged attack on a figure in Melee combat is resolved normally,
bearing in mind the Line of Sight restrictions. A Ranged or Melee
attack on a figure in Close combat suffers a penalty of -10. If the
attack misses, an additional attack with the same penalty must be
resolved against each remaining figure in that hex (in a random
order). If a multi-hex creature is in close with single-hex creatures,
it may be targeted normally.

\subsubsection{Special Attacks}

A figure may attempt to attack using any one of the following special
attacks.

\begin{Description}

\item[Multiple Strike] A figure who is armed with two prepared weapons
(one in each hand) may attempt a Multiple Strike. The two weapons need
not be targeted against the same opponent, but must be of the same
type (Ranged, Melee or Close). The Strike Chance of the Primary weapon
is reduced by -10, while the Strike Chance of the Secondary weapon is
reduced by -30. Ambidextrous figures suffer a -10 penalty with each
attack. A figure may not move while making a Multiple Strike.

\item[Multi-hex Strike] A figure who has a prepared two-handed B-class
weapon, with which they are at least Rank 4, may strike up to three
figures in adjacent hexes in their Melee Zone. Their Strike Chance is
reduced by -20 on each attack. A figure may not move while making a
Multi-hex Strike.

\item[Trip] A figure with a prepared Quarterstaff, Spear, Halberd,
Poleaxe or Glaive may attempt to trip an opponent in their Melee
Zone. The Base Chance is reduced to 40\%, and the damage to D10. If
the attack is successful, the target must make a 3 \x AG Check or fall
prone. This attack may not be attempted on a target significantly
larger than the attacker. A figure may not move before attempting a
Trip.

\item[Entangle] A figure with a prepared Net, Whip or Bola may attempt
to Entangle their opponent during any attack. If the attack is
successful, the target must make a 3 \x AG Check or fall prone. The
target must disentangle themselves before rising, requiring 2 Pass
Actions.

\item[Restrain] A figure may attempt to restrain an opponent by
pinning them to the ground. The Base Chance is three times the
difference in total PS \& AG between the attacker(s) and their
opponent. No damage is done. A restrained figure is treated as
incapacitated, and remains restrained until the restraint is broken by
an attack from outside the hex that does effective damage to a
restrainer. A Restrain may only be attempted in Close Combat.

\item[Knockout] A figure with any prepared Melee rated weapon
excluding entangling weapons, Lances and Pikes, may attempt to knock
out their opponent. The attack is successful if the Strike Check would
normally result in an Endurance blow (see \S \ref{combat:damage}). No
damage is done, but the target is unconscious for [D + 5] minutes.
This attack may not be attempted on a target significantly larger than
the attacker. A figure may not move while attempting a Knockout.

\item[Shield Rush] A figure with a prepared shield (other than a Main
Gauche or Tower Shield) may attempt to Shield Rush their opponent. If
the attack is successful, the target must make a 3 \x AG Check or fall
prone. This attack may not be attempted on a target significantly
larger than the attacker. A figure must move at least one hex before
attempting a Shield Rush.

\item[Disarm] A figure may attempt to Disarm an opponent with any
prepared Melee or Close rated weapon. The Strike Chance of the attack
is reduced by -20. If the attack is successful, one point of EN is
inflicted, and the target must roll under (MD + Rank) or drop a weapon
or item of the attacker's choice. If the item is being held in two
hands, the check is (2 \x MD + Rank). A figure may not move while
attempting a Disarm.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Resolving Attempted Attacks}

Every weapon and attack form has a Base Chance. The Base Chance with
all modifiers applied is the Modified Strike Chance. The attacker
performs a Strike Check by rolling D100; if the result is less than or
equal to the Modified Strike Chance, the attack has been successful;
above and the attack has missed. Particularly poor rolls may result in
the weapon being broken or dropped. Once a successful hit has been
made, a Damage Check occurs.

If the target is Evading, the attacker has a reduced strike chance
and, if they miss, they may be Disarmed or Riposted.

\subsubsection{Strike Chance}

When attacking with any Ranked weapon, the Strike Chance is (Weapon
Base Chance) + (Mod. Manual Dexterity) + (4 \x Rank). When attacking with
an unranked weapon, the Strike Chance is equal to the Base
Chance. Wild creatures using natural attack forms such as teeth,
claws, etc., always add their Manual Dexterity + (4 \x Rank).

\subsubsection{Modified Strike Chance}

An attacker's Modified Strike Chance is equal to their Strike Chance
plus any modifications for attack type and conditions, minus the
target's current defence. If the attacker rolls less than or equal to
the Modified Strike Chance, a successful hit has occurred, and a
Damage Check is made (see \S \ref{combat:damage}).

Attack condition modifiers are detailed in (\S \ref{tables:modifiers}
Strike Chance Modifiers).

\subsubsection{Evading}

If a figure evades, their Defence against Melee attacks increases by
10 + 4 / Rank of their prepared Melee weapon, and their Defence
against Missile attacks increases by 20.

If a figure is Evading, and an opponent in their Melee Zone misses an
attack at them by 30 or more, they may choose to try to Parry the
attack.

The target rolls D10, adds the Rank of the prepared weapon they are
Evading with, and subtracts the Rank of the attacker's weapon. If this
result is 3 or less, the attack has been successfully Parried, but the
target has been thrown off balance, and their next action must be a
pass action. If the modified result is 4 through 7, the target may
Disarm the attacker (see Disarm). If the modified result is 8
or above, the attack has been Parried and the target may execute a
free Melee Attack on their attacker as well as a Disarm. This is
called a Riposte.

A Riposte cannot itself be Parried, and may occur as many times in the
pulse as the evading target was Melee Attacked. An unarmed figure may
Parry if they are ranked in Unarmed Combat.

\subsubsection{Defence}

A figure's defence is subtracted from an attacker's Strike
Chance. Defence is equal to modified Agility, plus defence afforded by
a prepared shield, defensive manoeuvres and magic. Defensive
advantages due to terrain conditions and visibility modifiers are
covered in \S \ref{tables:modifiers} Strike Chance Modifiers. A figure
has no defence except for that provided by magic if they are stunned
or incapacitated.

A prepared shield provides defence against all Melee and Ranged
attacks that pass through a figure's front hexes, if they have the
Shield skill. At Rank 0 and each additional Rank, the defence bonus
(2\% to 6\%, see \S \ref{tables:shields} Shield Chart) is added to
defence. No bonus is given for an unranked shield. A figure may not
attack with their shield or count their shield as a prepared weapon
for Evading while retaining the shield defence bonus. A prepared Main
Gauche also provides some defence; however defence is only applied
against Melee attacks, and no defence is gained at Rank 0.

\subsubsection{Fumbles}
\label{combat:fumbles}

An unmodified Strike Check of 00 indicates that the attacker has
fumbled: they lose 10 from their Initiative Value until the end of the
next pulse. If the weapon is not Magical, or made of cold iron, or a
Bow, or a Crossbow, increase this chance of fumbling by
\begin{Description}
\item[1\%] any silver or true silver alloy of iron.
\item[2\%] any other hard metal alloy (\eg bronze).
\item[3\%] (or more) viable weapons made of other materials ---
the actual figure should be specified by the GM at the time of the
weapon's creation.
\end{Description}
When an attacker fumbles, they make a totally un modified D100
roll. If that roll is under their cur rent Initiative Value, they
suffer no further penalty for their slight fumble; if it not under
their current Initiative Value, apply the corresponding result from
\S\ref{tables:fumble1} or \S\ref{tables:fumble2} (the Fumble tables).

\subsection{Damage}
\label{combat:damage}

A successful Strike Check usually results in a Damage Check being
performed. Each attack has a damage modifier that is applied to a D10
roll, and the result is the number of damage points inflicted by the
attack (minimum damage 1). There are three types of physical damage
possible from a successful strike, depending on how successful the
Strike Check was: Fatigue Damage, Endurance Damage, and Specific
Grievous Injuries.

\subsubsection{Fatigue Damage}

Physical Damage affecting Fatigue may be absorbed by armour. Each type
of armour has a Protection Rating (as listed in \S \ref{tables:armour}
Armour Chart), which is subtracted from the Fatigue damage
inflicted. When a figure's Fatigue reaches 0, any subsequent attacks
affecting Fatigue are subtracted from Endurance instead. A figure
normally cannot lose both Fatigue and Endurance from one Strike Check.

\subsubsection{Endurance Damage}

A Strike Check of 15\% or less of the Modified Strike Chance results in
damage directly affecting Endurance, and which is never absorbed by
armour.

\subsubsection{Specific Grievous Injuries}

In addition to Endurance damage, a Specific Grievous Injury may occur
if the Strike Check is 5\% or less of the Modified Strike Chance. If a
potential Specific Grievous Injury occurs, the attacker rolls D100 and
consults the Grievous Injury Table (\S \ref{tables:grievous}). If the
roll falls within the range specified for the weapon class, a Specific
Grievous Injury has occurred, and the effects of the resulting injury
are applied in combination with any Endurance damage inflicted.

A figure who suffers a Grievous Injury while wearing armour has the
Protection Rating of their armour reduced by two until
repaired. Optionally, a figure who is also carrying a shield may
choose to have the shield cloven instead. A cloven shield is useless.

\subsubsection{Magical Damage}

All magical damage affects Fatigue unless otherwise states in the
spell description. Spell damage is assumed to be non-physical, and
thus unaffected by armour, unless the spell explicitly states that it
is affected by armour. Magical damage that is not affected by armour
never stuns. Breath weapons are treated as magical damage, but are
Passively Resistible for half damage.

\subsubsection{Additional Damage}

The damage inflicted with a particular weapon may be increased due to
exceptional Physical Strength or Rank. Only one of these two modifiers
may be applied at any time.

If a figure chooses to over-strength a weapon, they may inflict an
additional point of damage for every 5 full points of Physical
Strength they have over the minimum required to use the weapon.  Thown
or Missile weapons may not be over strengthed.  See
\S\{\ref{combat:unarmed} for Unarmed Combat.

If a figure chooses to apply skill to inflict extra damage, they may
inflict an additional point of damage for every full 4 Ranks they have
in the weapon. This affects Close, Melee Thrown, and Missile weapons.

\subsection{Effects of Damage}

\subsubsection{Missile Lodgement}

When a figure takes effective Endurance Damage from an A-class Missile
or Thrown weapon, the weapon has lodged itself in their body, and
reduces the figure's Agility by 3 (5 if a pole weapon). The Agility
loss for multi-hex creatures will be reduced in proportion to their
size. The weapon remains lodged until a Pass Action is taken to remove
it. A barbed arrow lodges if it inflicts any effective damage, and the
figure will take D-4 Fatigue damage when the barbed arrow is removed
unless it is removed by a Healer. Barbed arrows have a Strike Chance
penalty of -25.

\subsubsection{Stunning}

Whenever a figure suffers effective damage greater than one-third
their full Endurance, they become stunned.
\begin{Itemize}

\item They stop performing any existing Action.

\item They have no Melee Zone, but remain Engaged as long as they are
in the Melee Zone of an opponent.

\item Their Initiative changes (see \S\ref{combat:initiative})

\item They have no defence except that provided by magic.

\item Any shield or weapon (including unarmed) becomes unprepared. 

\item Their only Action which they may attempt is recover from Stun.

\item At the end of the Pulse in which they where stunned, a figure may
attempt to Recover from Stun.

\item The Base Chance to recover from Stun in 2 \x WP + current Fatigue.

\item They may not move on the Tactical Display, or change facing. They
may still perform Free Acts(see \S\ref{combat:free}).
\end{Itemize}

\subsubsection{Massive Damage}

If a figure with positive Fatigue suffers effective Fatigue damage
greater than their combined full Fatigue and Endurance, they lose all
their Fatigue and are reduced to -1 Endurance. If they suffer more
than their combined full Fatigue and 1.5  \x  Endurance, they are dead.

\subsubsection{Unconsciousness}

When a figure's Endurance reaches 3 or less, they must make a (current
EN)  \x  WP check or fall unconscious; this WP check is repeated every
minute. A figure on 0 Endurance is unconscious, but stable. A figure
on negative Endurance will lose one point of Fatigue (Endurance when
no Fatigue remains) until the bleeding is stanched by a Healer, or
until dead. A creature with a full Endurance of 5 or less does not
make consciousness checks. They remain conscious until they fall to 0
or less Endurance.

\subsubsection{Death}

When a figure's Endurance falls below negative one-half their full
Endurance, the figure is dead. Once dead, further damage may be
inflicted, but no more damage will be inflicted from poison or
bleeding.

\subsubsection{Infection}

Whenever a figure has had Physical Damage inflicted (or some
particularly nasty form of magical attack), they may have become
Infected. There is normally a 10\% chance of any wound becoming
infected. This is increased by (20 + Endurance Damage)\% if any
Endurance damage was inflicted. Bite, claw and talon attacks, hostile
environmental conditions and poor treatment may further increase the
chance.  See \S\ref{adventure:infection} for more information.

\subsection{Weapons}

Any instrument used to inflict damage on a figure is called a weapon.
Weapons may include the figure's hands, feet, teeth, etc.  All normal
weapons are listed on the Weapons Chart along with their
characteristics. The only limits to the number of weapons a character
may have in their possession are the weight and bulk of those weapons;
the GM should disallow any odd or unlikely method of carrying weapons.

\subsubsection{Normal Weapons}

The Weapons Chart (\S \ref{tables:weapons}) lists all the normal
weapons and their characteristics.

\begin{Description}

\item[Weight] The weight of the weapon in pounds (excluding scabbards,
etc.).

\item[Physical Strength] The minimum Physical Strength a figure needs
to wield the weapon properly; a figure without the required PS does 1
less point of damage for each point of PS they are below the
minimum. A figure may never achieve Rank in a weapon they do not have
the PS to wield.

\item[Manual Dexterity] The minimum modified Manual Dexterity a figure
needs to manipulate the weapon properly; a figure without the required
MD has the Base Chance of the weapon lowered by 5 for every point they
are below the minimum. A figure may never achieve Rank in a weapon
they do not have the MD to manipulate.

\item[Range] The distance (in hexes) which the weapon may be Fired or
Thrown.

\item[Class] The type of damage done by the weapon - A-class for
thrusting damage, B-class for slashing damage, and C-class for
crushing damage. This is used for determining Specific Grievous
Injuries.

\item[Use] The range(s) of attack the weapon may be used at: R for
ranged combat, M for Melee combat, C for Close combat. A weapon may
not be used at an inappropriate range.

\item[Cost] The standard cost (in Silver Pennies) to buy a typical
example of the weapon.

\item[Maximum Rank] The highest Rank attainable with the weapon.

\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Unusual Weapons}

A figure may attempt to strike bare-handed (see Unarmed Combat), but
only if one hand is free. A figure may attempt to use an item not
normally used as a weapon at the GM's discretion, who assigns Base
Chances, damage modifiers, and so forth. Makeshift weapons will
generally be no better than a Crude Club.

\subsubsection{Envenomed Weapons}

If the GM permits, figures may carry and use A-class \& B-class
weapons coated with poison. At least one point of effective damage
must be done for the poison to affect the target.

When anyone except an Assassin handles an envenomed weapon, they must
make a 3 \x MD check every time they handle the weapon. This includes
coating the weapon, preparing or unpreparing the weapon, and
attacking. An envenomed weapon will usually remain effective for 6
hours or until at least one point of effective damage has been
inflicted.

\subsection{Unarmed Combat}
\label{combat:unarmed}

Any figure may attempt to attack a hostile figure by using their
natural weapons. For many creatures, this is the only way they may
attack. Unless otherwise specified, all figures receive one Unarmed
attack per pulse without penalty. Some creatures may be able to attack
more than once (see Bestiary). A figure may achieve Rank with natural
weapons just as they may with any weapon.

The Base Chance for a humanoid to strike with their primary hand is
their modified Agility \x 2 plus Physical Strength over 15. The damage
modifier is -4 (+ 1 for every 3 full points of Physical Strength over
15).

Figures with Rank 3 or more Unarmed may kick rather than striking with
their hands, enabling them to attack with their hands full. They may
attempt to Trip with their feet; the normal Unarmed Base Chance and
damage apply. They may also use a kick as their secondary weapon for a
Multiple Strike Attack.

\subsection{Multi-hex Figures}

Many figures will occupy more than one hex on the tactical
display. Their size necessitates alterations in the resolution of
movement and combat.

Multi-hex figures have three types of hexes surrounding them: Front,
Rear and Flank. The exact configuration of Front, Rear and Flank hexes
varies with the size of the figure. Front and Rear hexes function in
the same way for them as for any other figure. Figures in Flank hexes
gain a bonus to strike (see \S \ref{tables:modifiers}), and are not in
the Multi-hex figure's Melee Zone, but do not gain the advantages of a
Rear attack.

A multi-hex figure may move in any way so that its head enters any
Front hex, and may move up to its full TMR in this fashion. At the end
of its move, the figure must be unambiguously oriented towards one hex
vertex. A reduction of 1 hex is suggested for each 120$^\circ$ turn.

A multi-hex figure may freely pivot or move into any hex occupied by a
1-hex figure. The smaller figure is knocked prone automatically and
the figure may then attempt to trample with a Base Chance of 40\%,
doing (D10 + size of the monster in hexes) damage. Trampling is
C-class damage. Subsequent attacks on the prone figure use the Trample
Base Chance and damage in the Bestiary. A multi-hex figure in close
with smaller figures does not automatically fall prone.

\subsection{Mounted Combat}

In mounted combat, the TMR of the figure (mount and rider combined) is
that of the mount; the rider may not move at all. A rider and mount
will occupy the hexes that the mount would normally occupy (as
specified in the Bestiary).

Controlling a mount during combat is dependant on the rider's
Horsemanship skill. An inexperienced horseman will have an incredibly
difficult time even controlling their mount in a chaotic melee; it
would be better for them to dismount and fight on foot.

\subsubsection{Action Restrictions}

Almost any action the figure is capable of while standing on the
ground may be performed while mounted. They may not (1) use a
two-handed weapon; (2) fire a missile weapon or throw a weapon while
moving; (3) use more than one weapon at a time. These restrictions are
lifted depending on the Horsemanship Rank on the Rider (see \S
\ref{skills:horsemanship} Horsemanship). A figure may always use a shield and
a one-handed weapon while mounted.

On a normal mount, the rider will not be able to attack figures
directly in front of them except with a spear (or similar long hafted
weapon) or any Ranged weapon. A mounted figure may not attempt a
Shield Bash (except against other mounted figures). However, they may
attempt a Mounted Charge. A rider may freely mount or dismount when
the mount is stationary, by taking a Pass Action; the difficulty of
dismounting when moving is determined by the GM.

\subsubsection{Charge}

A Charge on a mount is executed in the same manner as a Charge on foot
except the amount of movement prior to the attack may be greater and
the Charge must be in a straight line (no facing changes allowed).

In addition to the normal charging options, an unengaged mounted
figure may attempt a Mounted Charge. This requires the mount to move
at least 1/2 TMR without changing facing. At the end of the figure's
movement, they may make a Melee Attack with a +20 bonus to Strike
Chance. If the figure over-strengths the weapon, the Mount's TMR may
be added to the rider's Physical Strength. If using a Lance, the
Mount's Physical Strength may be used for the purposes of
over-strengthing (\S\ref{combat:damage} Additional Damage).

Any act of turning the mount or stopping it after the Charge will
require a Horsemanship Check (see \S \ref{skills:horsemanship}). The
pulse following any mounted Charge, the momentum will take the mount
past the target to its full TMR. Any attempt to turn or stop the mount
will occur after that movement is terminated. A failed check will
result in the mount continuing on its way.

\subsection{Aerial Combat}

Whenever an avian (or any other flying entity) is airborne, the
figure's height above the ground may have to be noted.

\subsubsection{Combat Ranges}

Hostile figures are regarded as being in adjacent hexes if the Range
between them is less than 10 feet. Hostile figures are in Close Combat
if they are in the same hex and the height difference is 3 feet or
less. For Ranged \& Magical Combat, the range of weapons \& spells may
be calculated using the following formula:

$A^2 + B^2 = C^2$ (Pythagorean)

Where A is the horizontal distance between the two characters, B is
the difference in their altitude, and C is the range between the
figures.

\subsubsection{Close Combat}

An airborne figure will be pulled from the air and become prone if
their combined PS + AG is less than that of their ground-based
opponent. Otherwise the airborne figure will remain in flight. The
ground-based figure may be lifted from the ground if the airborne
figure has sufficient Physical Strength and leverage.

An airborne figure may benefit from making a charge attack by diving
on the target.

\subsubsection{Casting}

If an Adept is flying and the Adept is in all other ways eligible to
cast a spell (has their hands free, is not out of Fatigue, etc.) they
may move up to 1/2 (rounded down) of their TMR and attempt to cast the
spell prior to, during or after their movement. This also applies to
all flying magic-using monsters and Adepts with flying mounts.

\subsection{Aquatic Combat}
Aquatic Combat may take place between figures at different depths. Refer to
the aerial combat section for guidelines. 

\subsubsection{Defence}
\begin{Itemize}
\item Defence caused by natural agility is halved for non-aquatics.
\item Non-magical defence is always halved.
\item Magical defences are unaffected.
\end{Itemize}

\subsubsection{Weapons}
If the character is on a solid surface then the following applies:
\begin{Itemize}
\item A class weapons are unaffected
\item B \& C class weapons have their non-magical base chances and damage halved.
\end{Itemize}

If the character is floating:
\begin{Itemize}
\item A class weapons have their non-magical base chances and damage halved.
Exceptions are tridents, javelins, spears.
\item B \& C class weapons cannot be used  Exceptions are nets and garrotes.
\end{Itemize}

Magical bonuses are unaffected.

Close combat is unaffected but the GM can rule that certain actions
are impossible.

Bows and crossbows must be waterproofed. The effective range of a thrown or
missile weapon is divided by 10.

No shield rushes are possible with a standard shield because of water
resistance.

Evading defence bonuses are 10\% + 2\% / Rank for prepared B \& C
class weapons. A class weapons are unaffected.

An unengaged figure is one who is not adjacent to any opponents. The
only disadvantage to being unengaged is that all engaged figures act
before any unengaged figures. All figures who are under a single
leader take their actions on the same Initiative, in any order that
they find convenient. A stunned figure may not act.

stunned or otherwise incapacitated may not attempt normal Actions. The
type of Action a figure may attempt is restricted by their position on
the Tactical Display, and their visibility. The use of magic in combat
is subject to restrictions, and may in some cases be impossible.

Multi-Pulse Actions: Some Actions that figures in combat wish to
attempt will take far more than one pulse. The following list is
intended as a guide for the GM to be able to judge how many pulses an
attempted Action will take to perform:

A figure who becomes Stunned may attempt no normal Action, but may
still take free Actions. At the end of each Pulse, including the Pulse
in which they were stunned, the figure may attempt to Recover from
Stun. The Base Chance of Recovering from Stun is 2  \x  WP + current
FT. A stunned figure has no Melee Zone.

\subsection{Fumbles}
\label{fumbles}
An unmodified Strike Check of 00 indicates that the attacker has
fumbled: they lose 10 from their Initiative Value until the end of the
next pulse.  If the weapon is not Magical, or made of cold iron, or a
Bow, or a Crossbow, increase this chance of fumbling by
\begin{Description}
\item[1\%] any silver or true-silver alloy of iron.
\item[2\%] any other hard-metal alloy (\eg bronze).
\item[3\% (or more)] viable weapons made of other materials --- the
actual figure should be specified by the GM at the time of the
weapon's creation.
\end{Description}
When an attacker fumbles, they make a totally unmodified D100 roll. If
that roll is under their current Initiative Value, they suffer no
further penalty for their slight fumble; if it not under their current
Initiative Value, apply the corresponding result from
\S\ref{tables:fumble1} or \S\ref{tables:fumble2} (the Fumble tables).

action (apart from Free Actions) until they Recover from Stun.

Figures with Rank 3 Unarmed may kick rather than striking with their
hands, enabling them to attack with their hands full. They may attempt
to Trip with their feet; the normal Unarmed Base Chance and damage
apply. They may also use a kick as their secondary weapon for a

\subsubsection{Weapon Breaks and Drops}

An unmodified Strike Check of 99 indicates that the attacker may have
broken their weapon; similarly, a Strike Check of 100 indicates a
potential weapon drop. In either case, the attacker must make a 3 \x MD
check to avoid the misfortune. The attacker also automatically misses
their target.

A dropped weapon usually falls in the attacker's hex, and may be
picked up later, but a broken weapon cannot be used. When a Break or
Drop is indicated for an attack where it is not possible, the attack
misses, and the GM may require that the attacker's next action be a
pass action to recover.

their character will do, or the character will take a Pass Action. The
GM should restrict themselves to a similar guideline for their NPCs. A
player may change the action they announced for their character to a

In any DragonQuest world, individual combat is an inevitable (and
sometimes necessary) occurrence, and the players should be aware of
its dangers.  Fighting is a deadly process and should be avoided if at
all possible.  Heroes are made by defeating the dragon, but more
graves are dug than heroes made.  The DragonQuest combat system
reflects these dangers and emphasises skills and smarts over brawn and
brutality.

Combat occurs whenever characters, non-player characters or monsters
attempt to physically overcome or harm other conscious opposing
figures while on the Tactical Display.  Combat should not occur
whenever entities simply encounter one another; rather only when some
overtly hostile action has taken place or intentions are made clear.

When combat has begun (whether both sides are aware of each other or
not), the GM should set up the Tactical Display and have the players
place the pieces representing their characters on the display with
the GM being the judge as to their final positioning.  The pieces
representing the hostile figures are then placed by the GM and the
combat sequence begins.

Combat time on the display is divided into 5-second Pulses during
which all figures may attempt to take various actions, depending on
their positions relative to the hostile figures.  The orders in which
these actions take place is determined by the figures' Initiative
Value (for engaged figures) or by the Initiative Die Roll (for
non-engaged figures).  Attacking is resolved by rolling D100 versus
the attacker's modified Strike Chance with his weapon.  If a hit
results, any damage is generated by rolling D10 and adding modifiers
by weapon type.

When all figures occupying the display are either dead, unconscious,
incapacitated, or friendly towards each other, combat is over.  Combat
should never last any longer than necessary to resolve the situation;
returning to normal interactive roleplaying as soon as possible will
speed overall play.

The following terms are used throughout the combat rules:

hexes per pulse while on the display.

\item[Weapon] Anything used to strike a hostile figure.

\end{description}

\subsection{Combat Equipment}
\label{combat:equipment}

To aid in the resolution of combat situations, the players and the GM
should have a number of items close at hand.  If these items are
prepared before combat begins, the entire process will take much less
time to resolve.

The Tactical Display is used to locate and regulate the movement of
the figures involved in combat.  It consists of a 25mm hexagonal grid.
Each hex represents 5 feet of space from side to side.  A number of
photocopies of this display should be made and butted together to form
large areas.  The GM may wish to cover the display with a clear
plastic (contact paper or acetate) to allow drawing on the display
with china pencils or other erasable markers.

If the GM wishes to use a 1-inch square grid instead of hexes, they
may, but should resolve any rules anomalies themselves.

When representing figures on the display, some form of markers must be
used.  Often lead miniatures (available from most hobby stores) are
painted to represent players' characters.  Cardboard counters are
equally useful, with counters being much less expensive but also much
less visually exciting. Beginning players often find the three
dimensional quality of miniatures helpful in visualising what is
actually occurring during combat. GM's will find that trying to
collect an arsenal of appropriate monster miniatures grows to become
inordinately expensive, and numbered counters may be used.  Special
monsters, painted and prepared by the GM for a particular encounter,
are useful to spice up an adventure.

The GM should have a copy of a completed Adventure Record and the
players should have their Character Records.  These contain
information which will be used continuously during combat, such as
strike chances, movement rates, etc.  If any NPCs or monsters are
involved in combat, the GM should record their characteristics and
information on a piece of scrap paper or index card.  This information
should be determined prior to the adventure if at all possible.  Any
damage taken in combat should be recorded on a piece of scrap paper
rather than on the Adventure or Character Records.

Percentile dice are used in the resolution of combat, and plenty
should be available (one pair for each player and the GM is
ideal). Also, copies of all the combat charts and tables should be
made so the players may readily refer to them.  The GM will often use
a GM screen to hide their die rolls, papers, etc., and the charts and
tables may appear on it.

\subsection{Preparation}

Whenever it has been determined that combat in some form is an
inevitable result of an encounter, the GM must set up all the
equipment necessary for the resolution of combat (see
\S\ref{combat:equipment}).  It is important for the GM to be as
organised as possible (have monsters' or NPCs' characteristics and
weapons pre-generated, have miniatures or counters ready, have the
encounter area mapped to facilitate easy transfer to the display,
etc.)  so the set-up time for combat goes quickly.  Knowing combat is
coming, the players will get more excited in anticipation, and now is
not the time for the GM to fumble with their notebook.  Each player
should have their playing piece and Character Record prepared and
ready.  There should be as little fuss as possible when placing pieces
on the display, and the GM has the final word as to the placement of
all characters, NPCs, and monsters.

If the GM has prepared the display to accept either china pencils or
markers, they should draw in the details of the encounter location.
This may be a hallway in a dungeon, a room in a castle, or whatever
--- wherever the party may encounter hostile entities is where combat
may take place.  If the display would be marred by drawing on it, the
GM should use dice or some other form of marker to record the
locations of important details.  Anything the players would be able to
see, touch, hear, or smell should be described to them, because
inventive players will scrape for any advantage they can found, and
are not above using a broken bottle, for example, as a thrown weapon
if they can find one. The players need to feel as if they know all the
details of the encounter location they could know if they were
actually there.  It is the sloppy GM who suddenly realizes they
haven't told them about the small window in the northern wall just as
the party is frantically scrambling to find an escape route.

\subsubsection{Prior to placing the hostile figures on the display, the
GM determines whether a surprise situation exists.}

Once the GM has determined if there is surprise (this information
should be conveyed to the players only if they are the ones who have
achieved surprise) the GM then places the hostile figures on the
display.  If no surprise exists, the distance between the two parties
should not be less then 8 hexes, and each group is aware of the other.
If surprise does exist, the distance between the groups should not
exceed 8 hexes, and can be much less depending on the GM judging the
degree of ``jump'' one group has on the other. In both cases, the GM
has the final say as to the distance separating the groups.

If surprise does not exist, Initiative is determined normally for the
first pulse of combat (see \S\ref{combat:sequence}). If surprise does
exist, the party with the advantage receives one ``free'' pulse during
which it can take any action it wishes without the surprised group
being able to react. After this free Pulse, Initiative for the
remainder of combat is determined normally.

\subsubsection{After placing all the figures on the display, the GM
assigns any Fatigue losses the figures may have incurred as a result
of their actions prior to combat.}
d197 7
a203 2
For the characters, the GM should use the system detailed in
\S\ref{adventure:fatigue}. For all hostile figures, the GM should make a
d205 1
a205 11
up to the instant of combat.  The GM may dispense with this procedure
if they feel the Fatigue loss would balance out or if they wish to
simply get on with and resolve the encounter.  If they assign
penalties from one side, they must make a judgement for the other;
they should never treat one party differently from another in this
regard.

Assigning hostile figures a high Fatigue loss is one method of
balancing a fight so the characters may be able to defeat a foe who,
on the surface, may appear vastly superior. This does wonders for
party morale.

combat sequence.  This sequence should be adhered to by the players
and the referee as this will greatly speed combat resolution.  Each
pulse, the following events occur in order:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initiative is determined for all non-engaged figures.

\item If any Melee or Close combat is possible, the GM groups the
engaged figures into engagements, determines Initiative for each
engagement, and resolves combat for each engagement separately prior
to proceeding to the next engagement.  Each engaged figure may choose
one action from the list of actions allowed of engaged figures on the
Action Summary (see \S\ref{tables:combat}).

\item
The side that won Initiative in Step 1 now has the option to take
action or let the other side take action. All actions of the figures
on one side must be resolved before any figures on the opposing side
may take action.  Note: It is entirely possible for Ranged, Melee, or
Close attacks to occur in this step as non-engaged figures move and
attack.  Each non-engaged figure may choose one action from the list
of actions allowed of non-engaged figures on the Action Summary (see
\S\ref{tables:combat}).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{A Pulse is a 5-second increment of time used to regulate
all actions in combat situations.}

Each action listed in Sections \S\ref{combat:engaged} and
\S\ref{combat:nonengaged} takes one full pulse to accomplish unless the
figure performing them has an exceptional Agility (see
\S\ref{combat:restrictions}), in which case two actions may be combined.
Magic may also alter the amount of actions taken in a pulse.

Some actions which figures in combat may wish to attempt will take far
more than one pulse.  The following list is intended as a guide for
the GM to be able to judge how long an attempted action will take to
perform in seconds (remembering each pulse equals 5 seconds):
d603 20
a622 23
\textbf{Action} & \textbf{Time} \\

\subsubsection{At the beginning of a pulse, Initiative must be
determined for all non-engaged figures.}
d627 56
a682 83
To determine Initiative, the Leader for each side rolls D10. To the
result is added the Leader's Perception plus their Military Scientist
Rank. The side with the highest total has the Initiative for the Pulse
(any ties are re-rolled).  When it becomes that side's turn to take
action, it may choose to act first or last, as it desires. That
decision is made after all engaged actions have been taken.

If the Leader is involved in Melee or Close combat, Stunned or
unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated, some other non-engaged figure
must roll for Initiative.  Their Perception (only) is added to the D10
roll for Initiative.  A non-leader may not add their Military
Scientist Rank to the roll.

The Leader for a party is appointed prior to an adventure.  An
alternate may be designated, but their alternate may not add their
Military Scientist Rank.  If there is any doubt as to who is the
current leader of a party, the GM resolves the dispute.

\subsubsection{For engaged figures, Initiative is determined by
comparing each figure's Initiative value.}

A figure's Initiative is equal to their modified Agility + Perception
+ Rank with any prepared weapon.  If the figure has no prepared
weapon, it is equal to their modified Agility + Perception.  In each
engagement, the figure with the highest Initiative value may act
either first or last, at their option.  All others must act in order
of their Initiative value, from highest to lowest.

If a figure is stunned, or has any rear hex toward an opponent, the
opponent automatically receives the Initiative.  Every character, NPC,
and monster should have its Initiative value for all the weapons or
attack forms determined prior to the adventure and recorded (for
characters, on their Character Record).

\subsubsection{An engagement is defined as any number of figures
occupying adjacent hexes, occupying the same hex, or any combination
thereof.}

Further judgement must be made by the GM as to the intent of each
figure.  For purposes of determining Initiative values, each figure
should be compared only to other figures who are involved in the same
combat, or who mutually mean each other harm.

Engagements are defined to allow swift, unambiguous resolution of
combat situations.  The GM resolves each engagement's combat
separately, and deals with the individual engagements in any order
they find convenient.

\subsubsection{When a figure chooses an action, it is assumed to be
performing that action until it may choose again.}

Thus, if a figure chose to move during the last Pulse, it is assumed
to be moving for all purposes of determining combat modifiers,
affects, etc.

\subsection{Actions of Engaged Figures}
\label{combat:engaged}

Being engaged imposes certain limitations on the actions which a
figure may attempt.  A figure who is engaged is defined as one who is
adjacent to a hostile figure on the display, and may have their
movement and choice of action restricted.

The order in which the actions of engaged figures are resolved is
determined by each figure's Initiative value, and any actions taken by
engaged figures are not simultaneous.

Two or more hostile figures who occupy the same hex are in Close
combat and are considered engaged.


\subsubsection{An engaged figure may Melee attack any figure within their
Melee Zone.}

If the figure who wishes to make the attack is within the defender's
Melee Zone, they may move only one hex within that Zone, and change
facing prior to attempting the attack.  They may not move or change
facing after the attack.

If the figure who wishes to attack is not within the defender's Melee
Zone, they may move up to 1/2 of their TMR either before or after
executing the attack.  Any facing changes may be made only after the
attack.
d684 1
a684 1
\subsubsection{An engaged figure may Evade.}
d686 2
a687 338
If the figure who wishes to Evade is within the defender's Melee Zone,
they may move only one hex within that Zone and change facing one
hexside while executing the Evade.

If the figure who wishes to Evade is not within the defender's Melee
Zone, they may move up to 1/2 their TMR and change facing as they see
fit (within the GM's discretion, see \S\ref{combat:nonengaged}) while
executing the Evade.

If a Melee attack is attempted on a figure who is Evading, with a
Ranked weapon, they may be able to parry or riposte (see
\S\ref{combat:attacking}).  Note: A figure who is Evading receives
defensive benefits versus Melee and Ranged attacks (see
\S\ref{combat:attacking}).

\subsubsection{An engaged figure may Withdraw.}

If the figure who wishes to Withdraw is within the opponent's Melee
Zone and the opponent also occupies at least one hex of the figure's
Melee Zone, the figure may Withdraw by backing directly into any of
their rear hexes but may not change facing.  While Withdrawing, the
figure may adopt one of two postures, Offensive Withdrawal or
Defensive Withdrawal.  If they choose the offensive posture, they may
strike at an opponent (at -20 to Strike Chance) before executing the
Withdrawal.  To adopt a defensive posture, a figure must have a
prepared shield (ranked or unranked).  While in this posture, they may
interpose the shield between themselves and any attack.  This adds
20\% to Defense, in addition to any other modifiers already in their
favour.

If the figure who wishes to Withdraw is within the opponent's Melee
Zone but the opponent does not occupy any hexes of the figure's Melee
Zone, they may move and change facing normally (see
\S\ref{combat:nonengaged}).  If the opponent is able to Melee attack
the figure, the opponent automatically receives Initiative for the
attack.  A figure may withdraw from one hostile figure's Melee Zone
into another hostile figure's Melee Zone.  If the figure wishing to
withdraw does not occupy a hex within the defender's Melee Zone, they
may move normally.

\subsubsection{An engaged figure may take any Pass action.}

If the figure wishing to pass is within a hostile figure's Melee Zone,
they may move one hex within that Zone and change facing while
passing.

If the figure wishing to pass is not within a hostile figure's Melee
Zone, they may move up to two hexes and change facing while passing.

A pass action is a generic term for any non-attacking action a figure
may do.  Typical pass actions include: preparing an item; preparing a
weapon; putting an item or weapon away; picking up a dropped weapon or
item; mounting or dismounting a riding beast; loading a missile;
dropping to one knee or prone; rising up, etc.

All of these actions are mutually exclusive; that is no two can be
attempted during the same pass action.

\subsubsection{An Adept who is engaged may attempt to cast a spell.}

If the Adept wishing to cast a spell is within a hostile figure's
Melee Zone, they may not move or change facing, and if attacked, will
have to perform a Concentration Check (see \S\ref{magic:combat}).

If the Adept wishing to cast a spell is not within a hostile figure's
Melee Zone, they may change facing after the Cast Check is performed.

An Adept who is in Close combat may not cast a spell, but may activate
Talent Magic (see \S\ref{magic:howmagicworks}).

\subsubsection{An engaged figure may attempt to Close and Grapple.}

If the figure who wishes to Close and Grapple is within the Melee Zone
of the defender, the defender may attempt to Repulse the attacker's
Close attempt.  If the defender wishes to Repulse, they roll D10 and
compares the result to their Rank with any Prepared weapon. If the
result is less than or equal to the Rank, the attacker may not enter
the defender's hex and must cease all action for that pulse.  If the
result is above the Rank, the attacker may enter the defender's hex
and execute a Grapple attack immediately.

If the figure who wishes to Close and Grapple is not within the Melee
Zone of the defender, the defender may not attempt to repulse the
Close attempt and the attacker may immediately enter and Grapple.
Figures that are larger than one hex treat this action differently
(see \S\ref{combat:multihex}).

\textbf{Note:} Any figure who enters Close Combat must immediately drop
any prepared shield and any prepared weapon not rated for Close
combat.

\subsubsection{A figure engaged in Close combat may attempt to Grapple,
Pass or Withdraw.}

A Grapple is an attack in Close combat against any figure who occupies
the same hex as the attacker.  It is assumed any figures engaged in
Close combat are rolling around on the ground, struggling with each
other.  Grappling may only be attempted with a weapon rated for Close
combat.

The figure who wishes to Pass while in Close combat may take any pass
action they wish (at the GM's discretion).

The figure who wishes to Withdraw, while in Close combat must first
attempt to ``break contact.''  The figure rolls D10, and adds their
(and any other friendly figures in the hex) Physical Strength and
subtracts the total Physical Strength of any hostile figures in the
hex. If the modified result is 10 or above, the figure may Withdraw
into any adjacent hex and is assumed to be prone.  In addition an
unmodified roll of 10 always allows Withdrawal.

\subsection{Actions of Non-engaged Figures}
\label{combat:nonengaged}

A non-engaged figure is one who is not adjacent to any hostile figure
on the display.  There are certain minor restrictions which result
from this, but non-engaged figures may generally take any action they
wish.  All figures who are considered on the same side or members of
the same party take their actions together and in any order they find
convenient.  In case of disagreement, the GM has final say as to the
order of actions.  No actions are considered simultaneous, and all
engaged actions of non figures occur after all the actions of engaged
figures have been resolved.

The determination of which side acts first is resolved by the
Initiative die roll (see \S\ref{combat:sequence}).

\subsubsection{A non-engaged figure may move any number of hexes up to
its Tactical Movement Rate.}

A figure's TMR equals the number of hexes they may move in one pulse,
and they expend one point of the TMR for each normal, unobstructed hex
they enter.  For characters and all NPCs, this total is determined by
their modified Agility (see \S\ref{tables:tmr}).

During movement, a figure may change facing as it desires within the
judgement of the GM and the fellow players.  Any complicated maneuver
the figure attempts may result in a penalty being applied by the GM in
the form of a reduction in the figure's TMR for that Pulse.  For
instance, turning three hexsides (a half circle) within one move is a
fairly complex maneuver.  The GM may decide if the figure wishes to
change facing to that degree, it may move two less hexes during the
Pulse.  At the end of movement, a figure must unambiguously face one
hexside (in the case of multi-hex monsters, one hex vertex).

The TMR assumes a flat surface with little or no hindrance to
movement.  The GM is allowed to assign a penalty for movement
attempted over terrain not conducive to quick traversal. In any case,
a figure may always (if not stunned, etc.)  move one hex during a
Pulse, no matter how difficult the terrain.

If a figure enters the Melee Zone of any hostile figure, they must
stop movement but may change facing.  If in the midst of executing a
Charge and Close action, they may then be able to enter the defender's
hex, depending on the results of the defender's repulse attempt.

If a figure wishes to jump during their movement, the GM may allow
this with a penalty of one hex for every 5 feet jumped (horizontally
or vertically) and make the figure who jumped attempt a roll versus
their Agility (with an appropriate difficulty factor) to see if he
landed cleanly.

Often two (or more) friendly figures will wish to pass through a hex
at the same time, or need to squeeze past another figure in the same
hex.  The GM must judge whether circumstances will allow or prevent
the move, ana if it is hindered, to what degree.  Thus, a halfling
should be able to squeeze past a human without too much trouble, but
for one human to move through a hex containing another human will
result in at least a TMR penalty of two hexes, and possibly be
disallowed if the human is currently engaged in some fairly active
situation (such as preparing a bow to be fired).

A figure may crawl at a rate of 1/4 of their TMR (round all fractions
down).

\textbf{Note:} Giant characters have their TMR calculated according to
the monster section pertaining to them.  The average TMR listed
is used as the midpoint of a chart the GM creates similar to the one
in \S\ref{chargen:giant}, with the appropriate giant's TMR replacing
the average human TMR of 5, with modification above and below that
occurring in a similar manner according to modified Agility as for
humans.  Thus, a Cloud Giant with a modified Agility of 19 has a TMR
of 14 (average TMR of 13 + 1 for agility = 14).

\subsubsection{A non-engaged figure may move up to 1/2 (rounded down)
of their TMR and attempt to Melee attack with a non-pole weapon, and
this action is a Charge.}

At the end of the figure's movement, if they are adjacent to any
hostile figure, they may Melee attack them (with a negative modifier,
see \S\ref{combat:attacking}).  The destination hex is counted when
figuring 1/2 of the TMR.

Consult the Weapons Chart for listings as to which weapons are pole
weapons.

\subsubsection{A non-engaged figure may move up to their full TMR and
attempt to Melee attack with a pole weapon, and this action is a
Charge.}

This action is in all ways similar to above, except the movement is
greater and using a pole weapon gives the attacker a bonus to their
Strike Chance (see \S\ref{combat:attacking}).  Some pole weapons use
this attack form from two hexes away (see the Weapons Chart).

\subsubsection{A non-engaged figure may move up to 1/2 of their TMR
(rounded down) and attempt to Grapple, and this is a Charge and
Close.}

This action is in all ways similar to a Close and Grapple, except the
charging figure has moved into the adjacent hex from outside that hex.
No facing changes are allowed during this action, and the destination
hex (the hex the defender occupies) is counted when figuring 1/2 of the
TMR.

\subsubsection{A non-engaged figure may move up to 1/2 (rounded down)
of their full TMR and Evade as they move.}

The figure must obey all rules of movement (see
\S\ref{combat:nonengaged}) and while moving is much harder to hit (see
\S\ref{combat:attacking}).

If a figure who is evading while moving is Melee attacked their may
(if their have a prepared Rank weapon) be able to parry or riposte
(see \S\ref{combat:attacking}).

\subsubsection{A non-engaged figure may move up to 2 hexes directly
backward, and this is a Retreat.}

The action functions in all respects as a Withdraw except the figure
may not adopt an Offensive posture since there is no adjacent hostile
figures to attack.

\subsubsection{A non-engaged figure may fire a Missile or Thrown
Weapon, or loose a Spell,and these are all Fire actions.}

A figure may not move or change facing in the same pulse as a weapon
is fired or a spell is loosed, with two exceptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Once a crossbow is prepared and loaded, a figure may carry it around
and fire whenever they wish.  In this instance, movement of up to two
hexes prior to or after firing is allowed.
\item
If an Adept or their mount is flying and the Adept is in all other
ways eligible to cast a spell (has their hands free, is not out of
Fatigue, etc.) they or their mount may move up to 1/2 (rounded down)
of their or their mount's TMR and attempt to cast the spell prior to,
during or after their movement.  This also applies to all flying
magic-using monsters.
\end{enumerate}

Only targets who occupy one or more hexes of a figure's Ranged Zone
may have a Missile of Thrown weapon fired at them.

\subsubsection{A non engaged figure may move up to two hexes and
perform any Pass action.}

Pass actions are listed in \S\ref{combat:engaged}.  A figure who is
passing may also change facing while executing a pass.  The actions
listed in \S\ref{combat:sequence} may require a number of consecutive
pass actions to complete.

\subsection{Action Choice Restrictions}
\label{combat:restrictions}

Normally figures occupying the Tactical Display may only attempt one
permissible action per pulse.  Figures with a modified Agility of 8 or
less are restricted in the amount of movement they may combine with
other actions.  Figures with a modified Agility of 22 or above gain
extra movement and may be able to combine two actions in one pulse.

Figures who become stunned or otherwise incapacitated will have their
choice of actions drastically curtailed.  The type of attack a figure
may attempt against a hostile figure is limited by their position on
the display relative to the hostile figure and the degree of
visibility which exists.

The use of magic in combat is subject to restrictions and may in some
circumstances be impossible.

\subsubsection{Figures with a modified Agility of 8 or less are allowed
one less hex of movement when executing any of the following actions:
Melee attack, Evade, Retreat, Pass, and Charge with a pole weapon.}

Thus, Thon the Dwarf, whose modified Agility is 7 due to both the
weight he carries and his lack of Agility, can only move one hex while
he prepares his Mattock instead of two.

\subsubsection{Figures with a modified Agility of 22 through 25 are
allowed one extra hex of movement when executing any of the following
actions: Melee attack, Evade, Withdraw, Pass, and Retreat.}

Thus Eaglewing the Elf, whose modified Agility is 25 due to the lack
of weight he carries, his natural Agility and his bonus due to being
an Elf can move three hexes while preparing his tulwar instead of two.

\subsubsection{Figures with modified Agility of 26 and above may
combine any two of the following actions in a single Pulse: Melee
attack, Evade, Withdraw, Pass, Close and Grapple, Grapple, Charge,
Charge and Close, Retreat, and Fire.}

The actions may be combined in any order. If a figure with this option
chooses not to combine two actions, they may increase their movement
by two hexes.

\subsubsection{A figure who becomes stunned may attempt no other action
except try to recover from being stunned.}

See \S\ref{combat:effects} for details concerning stun and stun
recovery.  A figure who becomes incapacitated can do nothing.

\subsubsection{A figure's choice of combat actions is limited by their
position relative to the intended target of their attack.}

A figure may only Melee attack a hostile figure they are adjacent to
and who occupies at least one hex of their Melee Zone.  A figure may
only Grapple a hostile figure in the same hex.  A figure may only fire
at a hostile figure who occupies at least one hex of their Ranged
Zone.

If a figure is attempting to Melee attack a hostile figure who
occupies a hex which is obscured (due to smoke, magic, etc.), they may
attempt to strike if they first roll less than or equal to four times
their Perception on D100.  If the roll is above this result, the
attack may not take place and the figure may take no other action that
pulse.

\subsubsection{If an Adept attempts to cast a spell while either being
Ranged attacked or Melee attacked, they must perform a Concentration
Check.}

This check may need to be done twice, once while preparing the spell
and once before loosing it.  If either check results in the Adept's
concentration being broken, the spell may not be cast.  No spell work
of any kind is allowed in Close combat, but Talent Magic may be
activated at any time and does not require expenditure of a pass
action to do so (see \S\ref{magic:combat} for more detail).

\label{combat:attacking}
d691 145
a835 148
A hostile figure may be attacked by Ranged, Melee, or Close combat
while on the display. To attack via Ranged combat, a figure must be
armed with a prepared weapon rated for Ranged combat and the target
must occupy at least one hex of the figure's Ranged Zone.  To attack
via Melee combat, the figure must be armed with a prepared weapon
rated for Melee combat and the target must occupy at least one hex of
that figure's Melee Zone.  To attack via Close combat, the figure must
be armed with a prepared weapon rated for Close combat and share the
same hex as the target.  Note: Empty bare hands are always
considered a prepared weapon.

The order of all attacking actions is determined by the Initiative
procedure as detailed in \S\ref{combat:sequence}.  Combat involving
engaged figures is always resolved prior to any combat involving
non-engaged figures.  An attacker's weapon is always assumed to be
held in their primary hand unless they state otherwise.  Optionally, a
figure may attempt to use two weapons at once, or attempt to strike
more than one target with one weapon.

Special types of attacks are allowed, and these include attempting to
Trip, Entangle, Restrain, Knockout, Shield Rush, or Disarm.

\subsubsection{A figure may attempt to attack a hostile figure they are
not adjacent to via Ranged Combat by executing a fire action.}

The attacker declares their target, determines and applies any Ranged
Combat modifiers (see \S\ref{tables:combat}), and executes a Strike
Check.  The only weapons eligible for use in Ranged Combat are those
rated for Ranged Combat on the Weapons Chart (see
\S\ref{tables:weapons}).

To fire a weapon, the attacker must have a line of fire to the target.
In addition, the attacker may fire into but not through an obscured
hex.  The weapon fired always travels in a straight line, and if not
stopped by striking an object, it will travel 1.5 times the range of
the weapon and fall to the ground.

Whenever a fired weapon enters a hex occupied by a figure (other than
a solid wall,  tree, or pillar which automatically breaks the weapon),
there is a chance the weapon will hit the figure instead of continuing
its flight.  The weapon's flight is always stopped when it strikes a
figure and remains in that figure until withdrawn.

A Strike Check must be resolved for all figures occupying any hex
along the line of fire until the weapon hits something, or loses
momentum and falls to the ground.

A figure may never check a line of fire without executing the fire
action, whether or not the weapon is actually loosed.

\subsubsection{A figure may attempt to Melee attack any hostile figure
who occupies at least one hex of their Melee Zone.}

The attacker declares their target, applies any Melee Combat
modifiers, and executes a Strike Check.  The only weapons eligible for
use in Melee Combat are those rated for Melee Combat on the Weapons
Chart.  The attacker may have moved adjacent to the target during that
Pulse and this combination of movement and Melee is a Charge
(\S\ref{combat:nonengaged}).

The normal melee attack is intended to do as much damage to the target
as possible, but other forms of specialised attack exist and are
detailed below.

\subsubsection{A figure may attempt to attack any figure who occupies
the same hex only via Close combat by executing a Grapple action.}

The attacker declares their target (there may be more than one figure
in the hex), applies any Close Combat modifiers, and executes a Strike
Check.  The only weapons eligible for use in Close combat are those
rated for Close combat on the Weapons Chart.  The attacker may have
moved into the target's hex during that Pulse and this combination of
movement and grappling is detailed in \S\ref{combat:engaged} and
\S\ref{combat:nonengaged}.

\subsubsection{A figure who is armed with either two prepared weapons
or one two-handed class B weapon may attempt a Multiple Strike.}

A figure may attempt to strike one or more targets more than once as
part of the same attack with two different weapons (one in each hand),
but suffers a negative attack modifier.  The attacks need not be
directed at the same hostile figure, but must be of the same type
(Grapple, Melee, or Fire).  Some non-humanoid monsters could attack 3,
4, or more times in one pulse using this option.

A figure may attempt to strike more than one target one time each if
the prepared weapon is Class B and the attacker is Rank 4 or above
with the weapon.  Each figure thus attacked must be in adjacent hexes
within the attacker's Melee Zone.  Thus, the maximum number of attacks
available via this option is three.  This attack may only occur in
Melee Combat, and the attacker suffers a negative attack modifier.

\subsubsection{A figure attempting to attack may specify any one of the
following special attacks:}

\begin{description}
\item[Trip]
The attacker must be armed with a Quarterstaff, Spear, Halberd,
Poleaxe, or Glaive and be in Melee Combat.  The Base Chance is 40\%
and the damage is D10.  If the attack is successful, the target must
attempt to roll less than or equal to 3 times their modified
Agility. If the target's Agility roll is successful, they keep their
footing; if they fail the roll, they fall prone.  This only works
against human size or smaller targets.

\item[Entangle] The attacker must be armed with a Net, Whip, or Bola.
The Base Chance is listed with the individual weapons.  If entangled,
the target suffers [D - 4] damage.  If the attack is successful, the
target must attempt to roll less than or equal to 3 limes their
modified Agility, falling prone if they fail.  The target must
disentangle themselves before rising, and to do so requires the
target to execute a pass action for two consecutive pulses.

\item[Restrain] A figure may attempt to restrain another figure by
executing a Grapple.  A successful attack results in the hostile
figure being restrained (pinned).  The Base Chance is equal to 3 \x
([PS + AG of attacker] - [PS + AG of target]). No damage is done to
the target.  A restrained figure is treated as incapacitated, and
remains restrained until the hold is broken by an attack from outside
the hex which does at least one point of effective damage to the
restrainer.  Several figures may combine their PS and AG to attempt to
restrain a hostile figure.

\item[Knockout] The attacker must be armed with any weapon except
Missile Weapons, Entangling Weapons, Darts, Grenadoes, Lances, or
Pikes.  The attack is successful if the Strike Check result is equal
to or less than (15\% of the modified Strike Chance + 10).  No damage
is done and tile target is knocked unconscious for [D + 5] minutes,
with the results of the time roll being kept from the players.  Note:
The Sap is a weapon especially designed for this purpose and is
detailed on the Weapons Chart (see \S\ref{tables:weapons}).  This
attack may not be attempted on larger than human-sized monsters.

\item[Shield Rush] The attacker must be armed with any shield except a
Main Gauche or Tower Shield. The Base Chance is 40\% and the damage is
[D - 2].  Rank with the shield will increase the Base Chance as with
any weapon.  If the attack is successful, the target must attempt to
roll less than or equal to 3 times their modified Agility, falling
prone if they fail.  If this attack is occurring at the termination of
a Charge attack, the Base Chance is increased by 20.

\item[Disarm]
The attacker must be armed with any weapon rated for Melee or Close
combat.  20 is subtracted from the modified Strike Chance before the
attack is resolved.  If the attack is successful, the target is forced
to drop one weapon or item of the attacker's choice and also 1 point
of Endurance damage is done to the target.
\end{description}
d837 1
a839 1
\label{combat:resolving}
d841 87
a927 134
Every weapon and attack form is assigned a Base Chance.  This
percentage chance may be modified due to weapon skills, attack type,
posture of the combatants, defense of the target, etc.  The Base
Chance with all modifiers applied is the Modified Strike Chance.  The
attacker rolls D100; if the result is less than or equal to the
Modified Strike Chance, the attack has been successful; above and the
attack has missed.  Rolling a 99 may result in the weapon being broken
and rolling 100 may result in the weapon being dropped.  Once a
successful hit has been made, a Damage Check is conducted.

If the target is Evading, the attacker suffers a negative modifier to
their Strike Chance and, if they miss, their swing may be parried,
leading to a disarm or riposte.

\subsubsection{The Strike Chance of an attacking figure is a
combination of the Base Chance of the weapon or attack form plus
modifiers for Rank and Manual Dexterity.}

To attack with any ranked weapon, the Strike Chance is (Base Chance of
Weapon) + (Modified Manual Dexterity) + (4 \x Rank).  To attack with
any unranked weapon, the Strike Chance is equal to the weapon's Base
Chance unmodified.  The Strike Chance of either a ranked or unranked
attack will be further modified.

In any natural attack form such as teeth, claws, etc., for monsters,
their Manual Dexterity + 4 \x Rank (if any) is always added.  For all
characters and other figures, the Strike Chance should be calculated
prior to an adventure and recorded on the Character Record.

\subsubsection{An attacker's Modified Strike Chance is equal to its
Strike Chance minus the target's Defense plus any modifications for
attack type and attack conditions.}

If the attacker rolls less than or equal to the Modified Strike
Chance, a successful hit has been scored and a Damage Check must be
performed (see \S\ref{combat:damage}).

Attack types include Ranged, Melee, and Close combat.  Attack
conditions include lighting conditions, which hand the weapon is used
in, and other miscellaneous modifiers.

\subsubsection{Whenever the Strike Check results in a roll of 99 or
00, the attacker may have either dropped or broken their weapon.}

If the roll is 99, the attacker may have broken the weapon; on 00, the
attacker may have dropped his weapon.  In either case, the attacker
then rolls D100: if the roll is less than or equal to 3 \x modified
MD, they have avoided either misfortune otherwise the misfortune
occurs.

A dropped weapon may be picked up by any figure at any later time, but
a broken weapon may not be used.  When this result occurs to an
attacker to whom it would not apply (a dragon's teeth really cannot be
dropped), the GM may, at his option, announce the attacker has fumbled
and may not attack the next pulse due to clumsiness.

\subsubsection{Whenever the Strike Chance result is 30 or more above
the Modified Strike Chance, the target may parry the attack.}

Only figures who are currently Evading and are being Melee attacked
may parry.  The defender rolls D10, adds the Rank of any prepared
weapon, and subtracts the Rank of the attacker's weapon.  If the
result is 3 or less, the attack has been successfully parried; but in
so doing, the defender has been thrown off balance and must execute a
pass action next pulse.  If the modified result is 4 through 7, the
attacker has been disarmed per the attack of the same name.  If the
modified result is 8 or above, the attack has been parried to the
extent that the attacker has become disarmed and the target may
execute a Melee attack instantaneously against them without need to
perform an attack action.  This is called a riposte.  A riposte may
never itself be parried and may occur as many times during a pulse as
the evading target was Melee attacked.  A target may even parry
attacks which do not come through their Melee Zone (e.g., from
behind).  An unarmed figure may parry if they are Ranked in Unarmed
Combat (see \S\ref{combat:unarmed}).

\subsubsection{A figure's Defense Rating is a combination of his
modified Agility plus any defense afforded by a prepared shield.}

A figure's Defense Rating is subtracted from an attacker's Strike
Chance.  The defense of a shield is a function of the Rank the target
has with the individual shield types (see \S\ref{tables:shields}).
Thus, a figure with a modified Agility of 13 and Rank 3 with shield
carrying a Large Round Shield has a Defense Rating of (13 + 4 \x
4\%) = 29\%, and this is subtracted from any attacks coming through
any of the figure's Melee Zone hexes.  If the attack comes through any
of the figure's rear hexes, the addition of the shield defense is
ignored, but the modification for Agility remains in effect.

Optionally, the shield defense may only be included for attacks which
come through the target's front hex and the hex facing the side of the
target in which the shield would actually be carried (normally in the
target's secondary hand).

The Defense Rating is not subtracted from any attacks if the defending
figure is stunned or incapacitated.  Also, any shield defense is
ignored for Close combat.  Any shield except Main Gauche is
automatically dropped upon entering into the Close combat.

\subsubsection{Each attack type (Ranged, Melee, or Close) has its own
list of Strike Chance modifications.}

After calculating the attacker's Strike Chance and subtracting the
defender's Defense, the Strike Chance Modifiers Summary, should be
consulted to see if any situations exist which could further modify
the Strike Chance.

\begin{example}
Rolf the Barbarian is Melee attacking the White Mouser, a lithe figure
with high Agility. Rolf is using a broadsword (which he wields at Rank
3), and has a modified Manual Dexterity of 13.  The Mouser has a
modified Agility of 18 and is using a Main Gauche (which he wields at
Rank 2).  Rolf's Strike Chance is 55 + 13 + 3 \x 4\% = 80\%.  The
Mouser's Defense Rating is 18 + 2 \x 2 = 22\%, which is subtracted
from Rolf's Strike Chance since he is attacking the Mouser through the
Mouser's Melee Zone (if he was attacking him through one of his rear
hexes, the 4 extra for the Main Gauche would not count and the Defense
would be 18\%).  But, furthermore, the Mouser is kneeling (+ 20 from
the Melee Combat Modifiers Chart), so receives a Modified Strike
Chance of 80 - 22 + 20 = 78\%.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{The charts listing modifiers used in calculating the
Modified Strike Chance of any attack include the Shield Chart, Ranged
Combat Chart, Melee Combat Chart, Close Combat Chart, Lighting
Conditions Chart, and the Miscellaneous Conditions Chart.}

See the Strike Chance Modifiers Summary for these listings.  Although
these listings may appear lengthy, few are used very often, and those
will be committed to memory after a few combats.  The GM is encouraged
to invent any other modifiers they see fit to add in any combat
situation.  They are the final arbiter as to what modifiers are used
and when they apply.  Any situations not specifically covered by these
listings must be judged individually by the GM.

\label{combat:damage}
d931 119
a1049 155
Whenever a figure is hit by a weapon or magic, a Damage Check is
performed.  Each attack type has a damage modifier which is added to a
D10 roll, and the result is the amount of damage points inflicted on
the figure.  Armour may absorb some or all of the damage up to the
armour's Protection Rating, and any damage points not absorbed are
inflicted on the figure and subtracted from either Fatigue or
Endurance.  Any damage points actually inflicted on the figure (not
absorbed by armour) are termed Effective Damage.

There are three types of damage possible from a successful strike,
depending on how low the attacker rolled on the Strike Check: Damage
affecting Fatigue; affecting Endurance; and Grievous Injury.  When the
Strike Chance result is above 15\% of the Modified Strike Chance, any
effective damage is subtracted from Fatigue (Endurance when Fatigue
reaches 0).  When the Strike Chance is 15\% or less of the Modified
Strike Chance, any damage directly affects Endurance and is not
absorbed by armour.  If it is 5\% or less of the Modified Strike
Chance, a Grievous Injury may also result, in addition to Endurance
damage.  These percentages are summarised on the Special Damage Chart
(\S\ref{tables:grievous}).  Any Damage Checks modified to a result less
than 1 are treated as 1.

\subsubsection{Damage affecting Fatigue is absorbed by armour.}

Each type of armour has a Protection Rating, which indicates the amount
of damage points subtracted from every successful attack.  When a
figure's Fatigue reaches 0, any further damage affecting Fatigue is
subtracted from Endurance instead.  However, a figure cannot lose
fatigue and Endurance as a result of a single Strike Check.

\begin{example}
Rolf is wearing Leather armour (Protection Rating of 4) has 3 Fatigue
Points remaining.  An attack against him results in 9 total damage
points.  The Leather absorbs 4 of those, and normally the remaining 5
would be subtracted from Fatigue.  But, since he only has 3 Fatigue
Points left, he loses 3 Fatigue Points and the rest are ignored
entirely.  If any further attacks result in damage being subtracted
from Fatigue, the Leather would still absorb 4 points of that damage,
but any remaining points would be subtracted from Endurance instead.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{A Strike Check of 15\% or less of the Modified Strike
Chance results in damage directly affecting Endurance which is never
absorbed by armour, and the stricken figure always takes the full
amount of the damage.}

The Special Damage Chart lists modified Strike Chances and their
damage directly affecting Endurance range.


\subsubsection{Grievous Injuries may result if the successful Strike
Check is 5\% or less of the Modified Strike Chance.}

If a possible Grievous Injury has resulted, the damage to Endurance is
first calculated and applied.  The attacker then rolls D100 and
consults the Grievous Injury Table.  If the roll falls within the
range specified for the class of weapon they are attacking with, a
Grievous Injury has resulted and the effects of the resulting injury
are applied to the unfortunate target immediately.  If the roll falls
outside the indicated range, no Grievous Injury occurs.

Weapons are classed on the Weapons Chart (see \S\ref{tables:weapons})
according to type: thrusting weapons are A Class; slashing weapons are
B Class; and crushing weapons are C Class.  The Grievous Injury Table
lists the ranges for each class of weapon.  A figure may suffer any
number of grievous injuries in a pulse.

Whenever a figure suffers a Grievous Injury, there is a possibility
they will drop whatever they are holding, and the procedure outlined
in \ref{combat:resolving} is used to resolve this occurrence.

A figure who suffers a Grievous injury while wearing armour has the
Protection Rating of that suit of armour reduced by 2 until repaired.
Optionally, a figure who is also carrying a shield can choose to have
the shield cloven and spare their armour.  A cloven shield is useless.

\subsubsection{Damage incurred as a result of a magical attack is
applied differently.}

Many spells attack figures with purely magical energy, while others
inflict damage as a result of changes in the physical surroundings of
the target (Windstorms, falling rocks, and the like).  When purely
magical energy is involved, any damage result is subtracted from
Fatigue (then Endurance), but is not absorbed by armour.  Other damage
types are also subtracted from Fatigue, but armour will absorb this
damage.

When being attacked by the breath weapon of a monster, treat the
damage as if magical energy, as above, but allow every target a
Passive Resistance roll before applying the damage.  If the target
does Passively Resist, the damage is halved (round fractions down).
No Active resistance is allowed versus breath attacks.

\subsubsection{The damage done with a particular weapon may be
increased due to exceptional Physical Strength or Rank.}

Damage is increased by +1 for every 4 Ranks (round down).  Add 1 to
the damage modifier of a weapon for every 5 points of Physical
Strength above the minimum necessary to wield the weapon the attacker
possesses.  Thus, a figure with PS of 20 through 24 would do [D + 5]
damage when wielding a Broadsword.  However, for every + 1 of damage
the figure receives, an extra 6\% is added onto the chance of the
weapon breaking during combat.  The above figure with the PS of 20
would have chance of breaking the Broadsword on rolls of 93 through
99, inclusive.  This increase in breakage chances precludes any
Modified Strike Chances which would conflict with it.  Thus, it the
above figure had a Modified Strike Chance of 97\%, it would actually
be 92\% since rolls of 93-99 would result in a possible break and 100
would result in a possible drop.  This does not apply to Missile
weapons, except spear thrower.  Currently, damage can be increased by
either Rank bonus, or over-strengthing, but not by both concurrently,
except for Missile and Thrown weapons.

\subsection{The Effects of Damage}
\label{combat:effects}

The ultimate result of incurring damage for any figure is death; this
arrives when the figure's Endurance negative one half.  When a
figure's Endurance reaches 3 or below, they may fall unconscious, and
only be revived by time or the arts of a Healer.

Whenever a figure suffers effective damage greater than one third
their original Endurance from a single strike, they become stunned.
The figure may not take any other action except attempt to recover
from stun until they has recovered.  A figure who becomes stunned may
drop anything they are holding.  (The procedure outlined in
\ref{combat:resolving} is used to resolve the outcome.  The check is
only performed once, at the moment the figure becomes stunned.)

A stunned figure who is engaged automatically has the lowest
Initiative value of the engagement; an unengaged stunned figure acts
the last of all his fellows.

To recover from being stunned, a figure must roll less than or equal
to 2 \x Willpower plus current Fatigue.

Current Fatigue is the figure's Fatigue total at the instant the roll
is made.  Every action after becoming stunned, the figure may attempt
to recover but may do nothing else, including move.

Note: Certain monsters begin with an Endurance of 5 or less.  These
monsters never become unconscious; they are either alive and alert,
stunned, or dead.

\subsubsection{A figure struck for Endurance damage by a Class A missile
or thrown weapon will have their Agility lowered until the weapon is
removed.}

Whenever a figure suffers Endurance damage from a Class A Missile or
Thrown weapon, it has lodged itself in the target's body and reduces
their Agility by 3.  The weapon remains lodged until a pass action is
executed to remove it.  When any barbed weapon is removed (arrow,
spear, etc.), the figure takes [D - 4] damage (not absorbed by
armour).  If the weapon is a pole weapon, the Agility loss is 5 and
the damage to remove it is [D - 2].
d1051 1
a1051 2
The Agility loss applies only to man-sized or smaller figures.  The
GM must judge the Agility loss for larger figures.
d1053 8
a1060 2
\subsection{Weapons}
\label{combat:weapons}
d1062 2
a1063 34
Any instrument used to inflict damage on a figure is called a weapon.
Weapons may include the figure's hands, claws, talons' feet, teeth,
breath weapon, etc.  All normal weapons are listed on the Weapons
Chart along with their characteristics.  The only limits to the number
of weapons a character may have in their possession are the weight and
bulk of those weapons.  The GM should carefully examine each
character, checking for the location of the character's weapons.  Any
odd or unlikely method of carting weaponry around should be
disallowed.  Any humanoid figure may never have more than two
one-handed weapons or one two-handed weapon prepared at any one time.
Carrying a prepared shield replaces one one-handed weapon and
disallows a two-handed weapon for this purpose.  Figures with more
than two appendages may use as many weapons as they are able. It is
always assumed when a figure is armed with a one-handed weapon it is
carried in his primary hand unless stated otherwise.

A figure may attempt to envenom any A or B Class weapon and thus
poison the figure it strikes. An assassin is trained in the use of
envenomed weapons (see \S\ref{assassin}).

\subsubsection{A figure need not use any normal weapon to attack.}

A figure may attempt to strike bare handed (see Unarmed Combat,
\S\ref{combat:unarmed}), but only if one hand is free.  Any figure may
attempt to use an item not normally assumed to be a weapon (furniture,
books, glasses, dishes, etc.)  at the GM's discretion, who assigns
Base Chances, damage modifiers, and so forth.

\subsubsection{The Weapons Chart lists all normal weapons and their
characteristics.}

All normal weapons which would appear within a common DragonQuest
world are detailed on the chart.  The characteristics for each weapon
are:
d1065 1
a1065 1
\begin{description}
d1067 2
a1068 2
\item[Weight] The weight of the weapon in pounds (or ounces, if so
noted).
d1071 4
a1074 4
to wield the weapon properly; a figure without the PS to meet this
minimum does one less point of damage for each point of strength they
are below the minimum.  A figure may never achieve Rank in a weapon
they do not have the PS to wield.
d1077 44
a1120 54
needs to maneuver the weapon properly; a figure without the MD to meet
this minimum has the Base Chance of the weapon lowered by 5 for every
point they are below the minimum.  A character may never achieve Rank
in a weapon they do not have the MD to maneuver.

\item[Base Chance] The base percentage of the Weapon to score a
successful hit on a figure.

\item[Damage Modifier] The number added to the D10 die roll then
performing a Damage Check; the modified total may never be less than 1.

\item[Range] The distance (expressed in hexes) which the weapon may be
fired.

\item[Class] A letter representing the type of damage done by the
weapon.  A weapons do thrusting damage.  B weapons do slashing damage.
C weapons do crushing damage.  Used for determining Grievous Injuries.

\item[Use] A letter representing the type(s) of attack the weapon may
be used in.  R indicates Ranged combat.  M indicates Melee combat.  C
indicates Close combat.  A weapon may not be used in an attack type
for which it is not rated.

\item[Cost] The cost, in Silver Pennies, to purchase the weapon.  At
the cost listed, the weapon is of normal quality.

\item[Maximum Rank] The highest Rank attainable with that weapon.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Figures may, at the GM's discretion, employ envenomed weapons.}

If the GM permits, figures may carry and use weapons coated with
poison.  Only Class A and B weapons may be envenomed.  See the
Alchemist skill for details concerning types of poisons and
paralysants.  For the venom to be introduced into the bloodstream of
the victim, at least 1 point of effective damage must be done.

When anyone but an Assassin handles an envenomed weapon, there is a
chance the figure will nick themselves and introduce the venom into
their own bloodstream.  Every time an envenomed weapon is handled, the
figure must try to roll less than or equal to 3 times their modified
Manual Dexterity on D100 to avoid any mishap, otherwise they have been
nicked by the weapon and are poisoned.  Handling a weapon is defined
as including all actions of coating the weapon with the venom, storing
the weapon until use, and preparing the weapon for the attack.  The
check should be made once for the preparation of the weapon and once
for the attack. The timing of the checks is up to the GM, but two
rolls should always be made if the weapon is used to attack.
Cleansing the weapon of the poison does not require a check.  An
envenomed weapon will remain effective for 6 hours, by which time the
venom will have evaporated or been wiped off.  When the weapon has
successfully struck and done 1 or more points of effective damage, the
venom has been removed.
a1122 1
\label{combat:unarmed}
d1124 73
a1196 51
Any figure may attempt to attack a hostile figure by using his hands
and feet.  For many monsters, this is the only way they may attack.
Unless specified otherwise, all figures/monsters receive one attack
with their hands/claws/bite per pulse without penalty.  Some monsters
may be able to attack more than once, and these individuals are
detailed in the Monsters Section.

For a humanoid figure to strike with their primary hand, the Base
Chance is (modified Agility \x 2).  For every point the figure's
Physical Strength is above 15, the Base Chance is increased by 1.  The
damage done by a successful strike is [D - 4], with 1 extra point of
damage for every 3 points of Physical Strength above 15.  A humanoid
can achieve Rank with bare hands just as they can with any weapon.

Beginning at Rank 3 in Unarmed Combat, figures may choose to kick
instead of using hands (or in addition to hands) in unarmed attack.
This allows an unarmed attack while a figure's hands are full.  The
Base Chance and damage are as above.  Using legs in this manner allows
an attempted trip (see \S\ref{combat:attacking}) with Base Chance and
damage remaining the same as for all unarmed combat.

\subsection{Missile Combat}
\label{combat:missile}

Barbed arrows or bolts may be used and these are -25\% to strike
chance.  A barbed arrow will lodge in a target on any hit doing
effective damage. See \S\ref{combat:effects} for withdrawing and
penalties.

Snap shooting performed at Rank 3 and permits loading and firing
in the same pulse.  This may only be done with Short, Long and
Composite and Giant bows and Slings.  Strike Chance is reduced
by 20%.

An aimed shot may be performed by any character ranked in a bow or
crossbow.  To use aiming an extra pulse is spent loading the weapon.
The target must be nominated at the start of the loading, and the
character must announce they are doing an aimed shot.  Strike chance
is increased by 20\%, the chance of an endurance is 20\% of modified
strike chance, and the chance of a Specific Grievous is 10\% modified
strike chance.  The GM must determine if aiming is possible.

A cranequin only requires a PS of 11, and can be used to load any
crossbow.  Crossbow damage is not reduced by 1 for each point of PS
below the minimum.  If the user has less than the minimum strength for
the crossbow then they are considered to be unranked (PS 14 or 20).

Bows and Crossbows may be constructed which require a higher minimum
PS to use than normal and do increased damage (1 damage for every five
point of additional PS).  Such weapons will cost more than normal and
can only be made by weaponsmiths who can make bows and crossbows.
d1198 1
a1198 3
Crossbows can be fast loaded if the user has ten more strength than is
necessary for the particular crosswbow. This reduces loading time to
one pulse.
d1200 3
a1202 2
Longbows are unable to be fired from horseback or by entities of size
less than five.
d1204 15
a1218 2
\subsection{Multi-Hex Monsters}
\label{combat:multihex}
d1220 1
a1220 25
Many monsters detailed in the Monsters Section will occupy more than
one hex on the Tactical Display.  Their size necessitates the
following alterations in the resolution of movement and combat.

Multi-hex monsters have three types of hexes surrounding them: Front,
Rear, and Flank.  Front and Rear hexes function in the same way for
them as for any other figure, but attacks through Flank hexsides give
the attacker a bonus.  The exact configuration of Front, Rear, and
Flank hexes vary with the size of the monster.

A multi-hex monster must always be placed on the display such that its
head unambiguously faces a vertex of two hexsides. It may move in any
way so that its head enters any Front hex, and may move up to its full
TMR in this fashion.  At the end of its movement, it must once again
unambiguously face a vertex.  For facing changes, a penalty of one
less hex of movement for each two hex vertices changed is applied,
since the mass being maneuvered is much greater than a humanoid's.
In order to change facing, the monster must pivot using its head as
the pivot point.

A multi-hex monster may freely pivot or move into any hex occupied by
a 1-hex figure. The smaller figure is knocked prone automatically and
the monster may then attempt to trample the figure at a Base Chance of
40\%, doing [D + size of the monster in hexes] damage.  Trampling is C
Class damage.
d1222 2
a1223 2
\subsection{Mounted Combat}
\label{combat:mounted}
d1225 1
a1225 24
In mounted combat, the TMR of the figure (comprising the mount and the
rider) is that of the mount; the rider may not move at all.  A rider
may only mount or dismount when the mount is not moving.  Any action a
figure is capable of while standing on the ground he is capable of
while mounted with the following exceptions: (1) using a thrown handed
weapon; (2) firing any missile or thrown weapon while moving; (3)
using more than one weapon at a time.  These restrictions are lifted
depending on the Horsemanship Rank of the rider (see
\S\ref{skills:horsemanship}). A figure may always use a shield and a
one-handed weapon while mounted.

A rider and mount will normally occupy only one hex, unless the mount
is a multi-hex monster.  If they occupy more than one hex, the
movement will be governed by the rules of multi-hex monsters (see
\S\ref{combat:multihex}).  On a normal mount, the rider will not be
able to attack out of their Front hex, only the hexes to either side
of that hex.  Their Front hex may be attacked into using a spear (or
similar long hafted weapon) or any fired weapon.

To control a mount during combat, the Horsemanship skill of the rider
is taken into account.  An inexperienced horseman will have an
incredibly difficult time even controlling their mount in a chaotic
melee; it will be better for them to dismount and fight on foot until
they become skilled.
d1227 5
a1231 9
A Charge on a mount is executed in the same manner as a Charge on foot
except the amount of movement prior to the attack will be greater and
the Charge must be in a straight line (no facing changes allowed).
Any act of turning the mount or stopping it during or after the Charge
will require a Horsemanship Check (see \S\ref{skills:horsemanship}).
The pulse following any mounted Charge, the momentum will take the
mount past the target to its full TMR. Any attempt to turn or stop the
mount will occur after that movement is terminated. A failed check
will result in the mount continuing on its way.
d1233 1
a1233 2
\subsection{Aerial Combat}
\label{combat:aerial}
d1235 3
a1237 125
Whenever an avian (or any other entity that is a flyer) is airborne,
the character's height above the ground and/or any obstacle may have
to be noted (especially in the case of combat situations).  When
calculating the range between two characters when one or both are
airborne, the following formula is used:
\begin{flushleft}
$\mbox{A}^2 + \mbox{B}^2 = \mbox{C}^2$. \\
A = the distance between the two characters in feet. \\
B = the difference between the height of the two characters from the
ground. \\
C = the range between the characters.  \\
\end{flushleft}
A figure may not attack another figure in Melee Combat when one or
both are airborne unless the Range between them is 5 feet or less.  A
figure may not attack a figure in Close Combat when one or both are
airborne unless they occupy the same hex and the height difference is
3 feet or less.  A figure may not attack another figure in Ranged
Combat when one or both are airborne unless the range to the target as
calculated in this Section is within the maximum range of the weapon
or spell the attacker is using.

The Base Chance of hitting an airborne figure is always reduced by 20.
The Base Chance of an airborne figure hitting a target on the ground
is reduced by 15 and the Base Chance of an airborne character hitting
another airborne figure is reduced by 10.  These reductions apply to
all physical combat, but not to magic.

Whenever an airborne figure occupies the same hex as another
conscious, unstunned figure and the height differential is 3 feet or
less, they are automatically in Close Combat.  An airborne figure will
be pulled from the air and made to adopt a Prone Position in Close
Combat if the combined Physical Strength and Agility of the airborne
figure are less than the combined Physical Strength and Agility of the
figure on the ground.  If both figures are flying or if the combined
Physical Strength and Agility of the airborne figure is equal to or
greater than that of the non-airborne character, then Close Combat
will be conducted with the airborne figure remaining airborne and,
possibly, with both figures airborne (GM's discretion as to how much
weight a flying figure can carry into the air in such circumstances).

An airborne figure can enter the same hex on a grid map as a stunned
or unconscious character, or of a figure who is 5 feet or more above
or below them without having to enter Close Combat.  An airborne
figure can benefit from making a Charge Attack by ``diving'' on the
target.

\subsection{Combat Example}

The following is an example of the way a typical combat will be
resolved, emphasising order of resolution rather than detailing the
actual die rolls and success chances.

A party of player characters is travelling by foot along a path deep
within a forest.  They are alert but not combat-ready; they are tired
from having travelled long and hard all day. The party consists of
Ariella, a Celestial Mage; Eaglewing, an Elven Ranger; and Delion, an
Elven Illusionist. The GM has generated an ambush for the party as
they round the next bend in the path.  Eaglewing is leading the party,
so his Perception of 10 is used for the check, but he also receives a
bonus of 15\% due to his Ranger Rank.  Eaglewing does detect the
ambush, and the Hobgoblin, Orc, and Goblin lying in wait will get no
surprise this day.  The GM determines they will attempt the attack
anyway, and combat begins.

The GM draws out the surroundings, places the characters' miniatures
on the Display, and then places the monsters' figures.  The GM then
determine the characters' Fatigue loss (due to their long march), and
adjudicates the monster's Fatigue status.  The GM allows the
characters to prepare a weapon, if they wish, because of the alertness
of Eaglewing.

\subsubsection{First Pulse}

The Hobgoblin (Perception of 13) is the Leader of the monsters.
Eaglewing is the party's Leader. The GM rolls Initiative for the
monsters, and Eaglewing's player rolls for the party.  The Hobgoblin
wins and decides that the monsters will act first.  The Hobgoblin
tries to goad his mount (a horse) to Charge Eaglewing.  The GM rolls
the Hobgoblin's Horsemanship check; it is successful and the charge
occurs.  The Hobgoblin is not close enough to Eaglewing at the end of
the Charge to Melee him with his Scimitar.  The Orc throws his spear
at Arielia and misses.  The Goblin fires his Crossbow at Delion and
hits him, profiting from the +20 bonus for attacking Delion from a
Rear hex.  Delion takes 9 points of Fatigue damage (4 of which is
absorbed by his Leather Armour) and becomes stunned.  He is unable to
hold on to his rapier, which falls to the ground.  Now the party may
act.  Eaglewing, having prepared his tulwar upon becoming aware of the
ambush, sets himself to receive the Hobgoblin's Charge by taking an
Evade Action (he has achieved Rank 5 with the Tulwar, so he thinks he
has a good chance to Parry). Ariella prepares a spell, and begins to
pronounce the magical incantations.  She may move up to two hexes.
Delion acts last as he is stunned.  He may only attempt to recover
from stun; he tries and fails.

\subsubsection{Second Pulse}

The Initiative roll is won again by the Hobgoblin.  He charges
Eaglewing and attacks.  His Strike Check is 37 above his Modified
Strike Chance, so Eaglewing may parry. He rolls an 8, plus 6 for his
Rank, minus 3 for the Hobgoblin's Rank, yielding a result of 11, a
disarm and riposte.  Eaglewing hits the Hobgoblin with his riposte,
doing damage affecting Endurance for 12 points.  The Hobgoblin is
stunned, and the GM checks to see if he falls from his horse.  He
does, and falls at Eaglewing's feet.  The Orc prepares his scimitar
and moves slightly towards Delion.  The Goblin begins to re-load his
crossbow.

Eaglewing attacks the prone Hobgoblin (the Riposte does not count as
an Action), receiving +15 for the Hobgoblin being Stunned and +20 for
his being prone (the Hobgoblin's Defense is not subtracted because he
is stunned).  Eaglewing strikes for a Grievous Injury this pulse and
kills the unfortunate Hobgoblin.  Ariella tries to cast her spell of
Starfire (knowing full well she is receiving -20 to Base Chance
because it is still daytime) and does, doing 13 points of damage to
the Goblin. Delion tries again to recover from stun, and succeeds.

\subsubsection{Third  Pulse}

This time Eaglewing wins the Initiative Roll (performed against the
Orc since the Hobgoblin is dead).  Since no one is engaged yet (the
Hobgoblin does not engage Eaglewing because he is dead), he chooses to
have the party act first.  He prepares his main-gauche, and moves
slightly towards the Orc.  Ariella begins to prepare another Starfire.
Delion picks up his rapier and changes facing to receive the Orc's
attack.

\subsubsection{Fourth Pulse}
d1247 2
a1248 19
Initiative is rolled between Eaglewing and the Goblin, since the Orc
is engaged with Delion.  Eaglewing wins it.  However, since the Orc
and Delion are engaged their combat is resolved before anything
else. The Orc's Initiative Value is 27, Delion's is 25, so the Orc may
act first. He attacks Delion, inflicting enough Fatigue damage with
his successful attack that Delion is out of Fatigue (remember, the
party's was tired to begin with). Delion, seeing the way the battle is
going, withdraws defensively.

Eaglewing chooses to have the party act first and allows Ariella to
try her spell before he himself takes any action.  Ariella, however,
is not so lucky this time and her spell backfires, reducing her
Fatigue to 0 and stunning her.  Eaglewing (frustrated at the Adept's
fumblings) moves up to the Orc, attacking him from behind.  He
receives a +30 for attacking from a Rear hex but a -15 for charging
with a non-pole weapon.  His attack is successful, doing enough
Fatigue damage to stun the Orc.  Delion cannot act now because because
he has already performed an Action earlier in the pulse.  The Goblin
runs away.

\subsection{Infection}
\label{combat:infection}
\label{infection}

At the end of every combat in which a figure is wounded, or when a
figure is wounded in a non-combat situation, there is the possibility
that figure has become infected as a result of his wound.  An
Infection Check must be performed to determine whether they are
infected or not.

The Base Chance of infection is equal to 10\%. If the figure took any
damage to Endurance, add (20 + the amount of Endurance damage in
points).  If the damage was inflicted by bite, claws, or talons, add
20.

Specific Grievous Injuries may raise the Base Chance even further.
The infected figure rolls D100; if the result is greater than the
modified Base Chance, the figure is not infected; if the result is
equal to or less than, the figure is infected.

An infected figure is considered diseased, and every morning after
becoming infected, the figure must try to heal himself or suffer
Endurance damage.  To heal themselves, a figure tries to roll under
their original Endurance on D100; a roll equal to or less than the
Endurance results in a cure.  If the infection is not cured, each day
the figure takes [D - 5] Endurance damage from the infection.
Obviously, an infected figure who is not cured will eventually die
from their wounds.  The effects of slow acting (blood agent) poisons
function in the same manner as infections except there is no roll for
cure.

they round the next bend in the path, and assigns a readiness factor
(see 80.2) of 3 to their chance to detect the ambush.  Eaglewing is
leading the party, so his Perception of 10 is used for the check, but
he also receives a bonus of 15\% due to his Ranger Rank.  Eaglewing
does detect the ambush, and the Hobgoblin, Orc, and Goblin lying in
wait will get no surprise this day.  The GM determines they will
attempt the attack anyway, and combat begins.

the determination has been made (this information should be conveyed
to the players only if they are the ones who have achieved surprise)
the GM then places the hostile figures on the display.  If no surprise
exists, the distance between the two parties should not be less then 8
hexes, and each group is aware of the other.  If surprise does exist,
the distance between the groups should not exceed 8 hexes, and can be
much less depending on the GM judging the degree of ``jump'' one group

For the characters, the GM should use the system detailed in 82.0. For
all hostile figures, he should make a quick estimate relating all
presumed activity they may have undertaken up to the instant of
combat.  The GM may dispense with this procedure if they feel the
Fatigue loss would balance out or if they wish to simply get on with
and resolve the encounter.  If they assign penalties from one side,
they must make a judgement for the other; they should never treat one
party differently from another in this regard.

A character may not attack another character in Melee Combat when one
or both are airborne unless the Range between them is 5 feet or less.
A character may not attack a character in Close Combat when one or
both are airborne unless they occupy the same hex and the height
difference is 3 feet or less.  A character may not attack another
character in Ranged Combat when one or both are airborne unless the
range to the target as calculated in this Section is within the
maximum range of the weapon or spell the attacker is using.

The Base Chance of hitting an airborne character is always reduced by
20.  The Base Chance of an airborne character hitting a target on the
ground is reduced by 15 and the Base Chance of an airborne character
hitting another airborne character is reduced by 10.  These reductions
apply to all physical combat, but not to magic.

Whenever an airborne character occupies the same hex as another
conscious, unstunned character and the height differential is 3 feet
or less, they are automatically in Close Combat.  An airborne
character will be pulled from the air and made to adopt a Prone
Position in Close Combat if the combined Physical Strength and Agility
of the airborne character are less than the combined Physical Strength
and Agility of the character on the ground.  If both characters are
flying or if the combined Physical Strength and Agility of the
airborne character is equal to or greater than that of the
non-airborne character, the Close Combat will be conducted with the
airborne character remaining airborne and, possibly, with both
characters airborne (GM's discretion as to how much weight a flying
character can carry into the air in such circumstances).

An airborne character can enter the same hex on a grid map as a
stunned or unconscious character, or of a character who is 5 feet or
more above or below them without having to enter Close Combat.  An
airborne character can benefit from making a Charge Attack by
``diving'' on the target.

of important details.  Anything the players would be able to see,
touch, hear, or smell should be described to them, because inventive
players will scrape for any advantage they can f.,nd, and are not
above using a broken bottle, for example, as a thrown weapon if they
can find one. The players need to feel as if they know all the details

whenever he wishes.  In this instance, movement of up to 2 hexes prior
to or after firing is allowed.  (2) If an Adept or his mount is flying
and the Adept is in all other ways eligible to cast a spell (has his
hands free, is not out of Fatigue, etc.)  he or his mount may move up
to @@ (rounded down) of his or his mount's TMR and attempt to cast the

To fire a weapon, the attacker must have a Line of Fire (see 9.0) to
the target.  In addition, the attacker may fire into but not through
an obscured hex.  The weapon fired always travels in a straight line,
and if not stopped by striking an object, it will travel 1.5 times the

but suffers a negative attack modifier (see 17.6).  The attacks need
not be directed at the same hostile figure, but must be of the same

attempt to roll less than or equal to 3 times his modified Agility. If
the target's Agility roll is successful, he keeps his footing; if he
fails the roll, he falls prone.  This only works against human size or
smaller targets.

\item[Entangle]
The attacker must be armed with a Net, Whip, or Bola.  The Base Chance
is listed with the individual weapons.  If entangled, the target
suffers D10 - 4 damage.  If the attack is successful, the target must
attempt to roll less than or equal to 3 limes his modified Agility,
falling prone if he fails.  The target must disentangle himself before
rising, and to do so requires the target.to execute a Pass action for
two consecutive Pulses.

\item[Restrain]
A figure may attempt to restrain another figure by executing a
Grapple.  A successful attack results in the hostile figure being
restrained (pinned).  The Base Chance equals the Physical Strength
plus modified Agility of the attacker minus the Physical Strength plus
modified Agility of the target, times 3.  No damage is done to the
target.  A restrained figure is treated as incapacitated, and remains
restrained until the hold is broken by an attack from outside the hex
which does at least one point of effective damage to the restrainer.
Several figures may combine their PS and AG to attempt to restrain a
hostile figure.

\item[Knockout]
The attacker must be armed with any weapon except Missile Weapons,
Entangling Weapons, Darts, Grenados, Lances, or Pikes.  The attack is
successful if the Strike Check result is equal to or less than (15\%
of the modified Strike Chance + 10).  No damage is done and tile
target is knocked unconscious for D10+5 minutes, with the results of
the time roll being kept from the players.  Note: The Sap is a weapon
especially designed for this purpose and is detailed on the Weapons
Chart (see 20.2).  This attack may not be attempted on larger than
human-sized monsters.

\item[Shield    Rush]
The attacker must be armed with any shield except a Main Gauche or
Tower Shield. The Base Chance is 40\% and the damage is [D - 2].  Rank
with the shield will increase the Base Chance as with any weapon.  If
the attack is successful, the target must attempt to roll less than or
equal to 3 times his modified Agility, falling prone if he fails.  If
this attack is occurring at the termination of a Charge attack, the
Base Chance is increased by 20.

If the modified result is 8 or above, the attack has been Parried to
the extent that the attacker has become Disarmed and the target may
execute a Melee attack instantaneously against him without need to
perform an attack action.  This is called a Riposte.  A Riposte may
never itself be Parried and may occur as many times during a Pulse as
the evading target was Melee attacked.  A target may even Parry
attacks which do not come through his Melee Zone (e.g., from behind
him).  An unarmed figure may Parry if he is Ranked in Unarmed Combat
(see 21.0).

figure with a modified Agility of 13 and Rank 3 with shield carrying a
Large Round Shield has a Defense Rating of [ 13 + (4 \x 4\%)) = 29\%,
and this is subtracted from any attacks coming through any of the
figure's Melee Zone hexes.  If the attack comes through any of the
figure's rear hexes, the addition of the shield defense is ignored,

crushing weapons are C Class.  The Grievous Injury Table lists the
ranges for each class of weapon.  A figure may suffer any number of
grievous injuries in a Pulse.

Whenever a figure suffers a Grievous Injury, there is a possibility he
has dropped whatever he is holding, and the procedure outlined in 17.3
is used to resolve this occurrence.

d1163 16
a1178 21
If using this rule, add 1 to the damage modifier of a weapon for every
5 points of Physical Strength above the minimum necessary to wield the
weapon the attacker possesses.  Thus, a figure with PS of 20 through
24 would do [D + 5] damage when wielding a Broadsword.  However, for
every + 1 of damage the figure receives, an extra 6\% is added onto
the chance of the weapon breaking during combat.  The above figure with
the PS of 2O would have chance of breaking the Broadsword on rolls of
93 through 99, inclusive.  This increase in breakage chances
precludes any Modified Strike Chances which would conflict with it.
Thus, it the above figure had a Modified Strike Chance of 97\%, it
would actually be 92\% since rolls of 93-99 would result in a
possible break and 100 would result in a possible drop.  This does not
apply to Thrown or Missile Weapons.

If wishing to allow increased damage for bonus for every 4 Ranks
(round down).  This Rank attained with a weapon, give a +1 rule will
increase damage done by Thrown or Missile Weapons, and does not
increase breakage chances.  It is recommended only one of these
systems be used with any one particular weapon, not both.

chance the figure will nick himself and introduce the venom into his
own bloodstream.  Every time an envenomed weapon is handled, the
figure must try to roll less than or equal to 3 times his modified
Manual Dexterity on D100 to avoid any mishap. If the roll is greater
than his MD, he has been nicked by the weapon and is poisoned.
Handling a weapon is defined as including all actions of coating the
weapon with the venom, storing the weapon until use, and preparing the
weapon for the attack.  The check should be made once for the
preparation of the weapon and once for the attack. The timing of the
checks is up to the GM, but two rolls should always be made if the
weapon is used to attack.  Cleansing the weapon of the poison does not
require a check.  An envenomed weapon will remain effective for 6
hours, by which time the venom will have evaporated or been wiped off.
When the weapon has successfully struck and done I or more points of
effective damage, the venom has been removed.

\subsubsection{A figure struck by a Class A missile or thrown weapon
will have his Agility lowered until the weapon is removed.}

Whenever a figure suffers effective damage from a A Class Missile or
Thrown weapon, it has lodged itself in the target's body and reduces
their Agility by 3.  The weapon remains lodged until a Pass action is
executed to remove it.  When any barbed weapon is removed (arrow,
spear, etc.), the figure takes [D - 4] damage (not absorbed by armour).
If the weapon is a Pole weapon, the Agility loss is 5 and the damage
to remove it is [D - 2].

The Agility loss applies only to man-sized or smaller figures.  The
GM must judge the Agility loss for larger figures.

 the figure takes [D - 5] Endurance damage from the infection.

     In    any    DragonQuest    world,     individual
combat  is   an   inevitable   (and   sometimes   ne-
cessary)   occurrence,   and   the   players   should
be  aware  of  its  dangers.  Fighting  is  a  deadly
process and  should  be  avoided  if  at  all  possi-
ble.  Heroes  are  made   by   defeating   the   dra-
gon,  but   more   graves   are   dug   than   heroes
made.   The    DragonQuest    combat    system    re-
flects  these  dangers  and  emphasizes  skills   and
smarts over brawn and brutality.

     Combat      occurs      whenever       characters
non-player   characters,    or    monsters    attempt
to   physically   overcome   or   harm   other   con-
scious  opposing  figures  while  ori  the   Tactical
Display  or  in  the  Chase  Stage  (see  80).   Com-
bat  should  not  occur   whenever   entities   simp-
ly  encounter   one   another;   rather   only   when
some  overtly  hostile  action  has  taken  place  or
intentions are made clear.

     When   combat    has    begun    (whether    both
sides are  aware  of  each  other  or  not),  the  GM
should  set  up  the  Tactical   Display   and   have
the players  place  th.-  pieces  representing  their
characters  on  the  display  with   the   GM   being
the  judge  as  to  their  final   positioning.   The
pieces   representing   the   hostile   figures   are
then  placed  by  the   GM   and   the   combat   se-
quence begins.

     Combat   time   on   the   display   is   divided
into  5-second  Pulses  during  which   all   figures
may  attempt  to  take   various   actions,   depend-
ing  on  their  positions  relative  to  the  hostile
figures.  The   orders   in   which   these   actions
take place  is  determined  by  the  figures'  Initi-
ative Value (for  engaged  figures)  or  by  the  In-
itiative  Die   Roll   (for   non-engaged   figures).
Attacking  is  resolved  by   rolling   DIOO   versus
the   attacker's   modified   Strike   Chance    with
his  weapon.  If  a  hit  results,  any   damage   is
generated  by  rolling   DIO   and   adding   modifi-
ers by weapon type.

     When   all   figures   occupying   the   display
are   either   dead,   unconscious,    incapacitated,
or   friendly   towards   each   other,   combat   is
over.   Combat   should   never   last   any   longer
than   necessary   to    resolve    the    situation;
returning  to  the  Trek/Wait  stage  (see   80)   as
soon as possible will speed overall play.

late   medieval   hand-to-hand   combat   for    fan-
tasy    campaigning.    For    those    who    desire

     To aid in  the  resolution  of  combat  situa-
tions, the  players  and  the  GM  should  have  a
number of items close  at  hand.  If  these  items
a . re  prepared  before  combat   begins,   the   en-
tire  process  will  take  much   less   time   to
resolve.

     The  Tactical  Display  is  used   to   locate
and regulate  the  movement  of  the  figures  in-
volved in combat.  It  consists  of  a  25mm  hex-
agonal grid,  an  example  of  which  is  included
in this rules book. Each  hex  represents  5  feet
of space from side  to  side.  A  number  of  pho-
tocopies  of  this  display  should  be  made  and
butted  together  to  form  large  areas.  The  GM
may  wish  to  cover  the  display  with  a  clear
plastic  (contact  paper  or  acetate)  to   allow
drawing on  the  display  with  china  pencils  or
other erasable markers. If  the  players  and  the
GM  wish  a   detailed,   rugged,   25mm   hexgrid
for  use   with   DragonQuest's   combat   system,
one is available from the publisher.

     If the  GM  wishes  to  use  a  I-inch  square
grid  instead  of  hexes,  he  may,   but   should
resolve any rules anomalies himself.

     When  representing   figures   on   the   dis-
play,  some  form  of  markers   must   be   used.
Often  lead  miniatures   (available   from   most
hobby   stores)   are   painted    to    represent
players'  characters.   Cardboard   counters   are
equally useful,  with  counters  being  much  less
expensive  but  also  much  less  visually  excit-
ing. Beginning players often find  the  three  di-
mensional quality of  miniatures  helpful  in  vi-
sualizing  what  is  actually   occurring   during
combat. GM's will  find  that  trying  to  collect
an  arsenal  of  appropriate  monster   miniatures
grows  to  become  inordinately   expensive,   and
numbered   counters   may   be    used.    Special
monsters,  painted  and   prepared   by   the   GM
for a particular encounter, are  useful  to  spice
up an adventure.

     The  GM  should  have  a  copy  of   a   com-
pleted   Adventure   Record   and   the    players
should  have  their   Character   Records.   These
contain  information  which  will  be  used   con-
tinuousiv   during   combat,   such   as    strike
chances,  movement  rates,  etc.  If   any   NPC's
or  monsters  are  involved  in  combat,  the   GM
should record  their  characteristics  and  infor-
mation  on  a  piece  of  scrap  paper  or   index
card.  This  information  should   be   determined
prior to the adventure if  at  all  possible.  Any
damage  taken  in  combat   should   be   recorded
on a piece of  scrap  paper  rather  than  on  the
Adventure    or    Character    Records.     Blank
copies  of  these  two  records  are  included  in
this book.

     Percentile dice are used  in  the  resolution
of  combat,  and  plenty   should   be   available
(one  pair  for  each  player  and   the   GM   is
ideal). Also, copies  of  all  the  combat  charts
and tables should  be  made  so  the  players  may
readily refer to  them.  The  GM  will  often  use
a GM screen to hide his die rolls,  papers,  etc.,
and the  charts  and  tables  may  appear  on  it.
SPI  sells  a  screen  designed  for   DragonQuest
containing  copies  of  all  the   needed   combat
charts   and   tables.   Purchasers   should    be
aware  to  buy  only  the  1981  version  of   the
screen, as  earlier  versions  contain  charts  no
longer used.

Whenever  it   has   been   determined   that
combat  in  some  form  is  an  inevitable  result
         of an encounter,  the  GM  must  set  up  all  the
             equipment  necessary   for   the   resolution   of
                       combat (see 10.).  It  is  important  for  the  GM
                       to  be  as  organized  as  possible   (have   mon-
                       sters'  or  NPC's  characteristics   and   weapons
                 pre-generated,   have   miniatures   or   counters
                  ready,  have  the   encounter   area   mapped   to
                       facilitate easy transfer to the display, etc.)  so
                       the  set-up  time   for   combat   goes   quickly.
                       Knowing  combat  is  coming,  the   players   will
                       get more  excited  in  anticipation,  and  now  is
                       not the  time  for  the  GM  to  fumble  with  his
                       notebook.  Each  player  should  have  his   play-
                       ing  piece  and  Character  Record  prepared   and
                       ready. There should be as little  fuss  as  possi-
                       ble  when  placing  pieces  on  the  display,  and
                       the GM  has  the  final  word  as  to  the  place-
                       ment  of  all  characters,  NPC'S,  and  monsters.

                       If  the  GM  has  prepared  the   display   to
                  accept  either  china  pencils  or   markers,   he
                       should  draw  in  the  details  of  the  encounter
                   location.  This  may  be  a  hallway  in  a   dun-
                       geon,  a  room  in  a  castle,   or   whatever   -
                   wherever  the  party  may  encounter  hostile  en-
                       tities is where combat  may  take  place.  If  the
                    display  would  be  marred  by  drawing   on   it,
                       the  GM  should  use  dice  or  some  other   form
                 of  marker  to  record  the  locations  of  impor-
                       tant  details.  Anything  the  players  would   be
                   able to see,  touch,  hear,  or  smell  should  be
                       described  to  them,  because  inventive   players
                    will scrape for  any  advantage  they  can  f.,nd,
                       and are not  above  using  a  broken  bottle,  for
example,  as  a  thrown  weapon  if  they  can  find
one. The players  need  to  feel  as  if  they  know
all the  details  of  the  encounter  location  they
could know  if  they  were  actually  there.  It  is
the   sloppy   GM   who   suddenly    realizes    he
hasn't  told  them   about   the   small   window.in
the northern wall just  as  the  party  is  frantic-
ally scrambling to find an escape route.
d237 17
a253 24
     See  80.2  for  the  procedure   to   determine
whether  surprise  exists.  Once  the   determina-
tion  has  been  made   (this   information   should
be conveyed to the players  only  if  they  are  the
ones   who   have   achieved   surprise)   the    GM
then places the  hostile  figures  on  the  display.
If no surprise  exists,  the  distance  between  the
two  parties  should  not  be  less  then  8  hexes,
and each group  is  aware  of  the  other.  If  sur-
prise  does  exist,   the   distance   between   the
groups  should  not  exceed  8  hexes,  and  can  be
much  less  depending  on   the   GM   judging   the
degree   of   "jump"   one   group   has   on    the
other. In both cases,  the  GM  has  the  final  say
as to the distance separating the groups.

     If surprise does not exist, Initiative  is  de-
termined  normally  for  the  first  Pulse  of  com-
bat (see 12.2). If surprise does  exist,  the  party
-A,ith  the  advantage  receives  one  "free"  Pulse
during which  it  can  take  any  action  it  wishes
without  the   surprised   group   being   able   to
react. After this free  Pulse,  Initiative  for  the
remainder  of   combat   is   determined   normally.
d259 13
a271 18
     For  the  characters,   the   GM   should   use
the system detailed in 82.0. For  all  hostile  fig-
ures,  he  should  make  a  quick  estimate   relat-
ing  all  presumed  activity  they  may   have   un-
dertaken  up  to  the   instant   of   combat.   The
GM may dispense with this procedure if he
feels the Fatigue  loss  would  balance  out  or  if
he  wishes  to  simply  get  on  with  and   resolve
the  encounter.  If  he   assigns   penalties   from
one  side,  he  must  make  a   judgment   for   the
other; he  should  never  treat  one  party  differ-
ently from another in this regard.

     Assigning  hostile  figures  a   high   Fatigue
loss is one method  of  balancing  a  fight  so  the
characters  may  be  able  to  defeat  a  foe   whO,
on  the  surface,  may   appear   vastly   superior,
This does wonders for party morale.

     The  order  in  which  all  actions   are   at-
tempted  in  a  Pulse  is  called  the  combat   se-
quence.  This  sequence   should   be   adhered   to
by  the  players  and  the  referee  as  this   will
greatly speed play.
     Each  Pulse,   the   following   events   occur
in order:

\item      Initiative  is  determined  for  all  non-engag-
ed figures.
d284 6
a289 9
\item      If  any  Melee  or  Close  combat  is  possible,
the  GM  groups  the  engaged   figures   into   en-
gagements,  determines  Initiative  for   each   en-
gagement,  and  resolves   combat   for   each   en-
gagement   separately   prior   to   proceeding   to
the   next   engagement.   Each    engaged    figure
may  choose  one  action  from  the  list  of   ac-
tions  allowed  of  engaged  figures  on  the   Ac-
ti on Summary (see 15.7).
d292 8
a299 11
     The side that  won  Initiative  in  Step  I  now
has the option to take  action  or  let  the  other
side take action. All actions  of  the  figures  on
one side must be resolved  before  any  figures  on
the opposing side may  take  action.  Note:  It  is
entirely  possible  for  Ranged,  Melee,  or  Close
attacks  to  occur  in  this  step  as  non-engaged
figures   move   and   attack.   Each   non-engaged
figure may choose  one  action  from  the  list  of
actions   allowed   of   non-engaged   figures   on
the Action Summary (see 15.7).
d303 3
a305 4
     After  these   steps   are   performed,   the
Pulse is over  and  a  new  one  begins.  See  78.3
for  guidelines  regarding  speedy  resolution   of
combat actions.
d310 35
a344 44
     Each action listed  in  Sections  13  and  14
takes one  full  Pulse  to  accomplish  unless  the
figure   performing   them   has   an   exceptional
Agility (see  15.3),  in  which  case  two  actions
may  be  combined.  Magic  may   also   alter   the
amount of actions taken in a Pulse.

     Some  actions   which   figures   in   combat
may  wish  to  attempt  will  take  far  more  than
one Pulse. The following  list  is  intended  as  a
guide  for  the  GM  to  be  able  to   judge   how
long an  attempted  action  will  take  to  perform

(remembering  each   Pulse   equals   5    seconds):

     To  determine  Initiative,  the  Leader   for
each side rolls DIO. To the  result  is  added  the
Leader's Perception  plus  his  Military  Scientist
Rank. The side  with  the  highest  total  has  the
Initiative   for   the   Pulse   (any   ties    are
re-rolled).  When  it  becomes  that  side's   turn
to take action, it  may  choose  to  act  first  or
last, as it desires. That decision  is  made  after
all engaged actions have been taken.

     If  the  Leader  is  involved  in   Melee   or
Close   combat,   Stunned   or    unconscious,    or
otherwise    incapacitated,    some    other    non-
engaged  figure  must  roll  for   Initiative.   His
Perception (only) is  added  to  the  DIO  roll  for
Initiative.  A  non-leader  may  not  add  his  Mil-
itary Scientist Rank to the roll.

     The Leader for  a  party  is  appointed  prior
to  an  adventure.  An  alternate  may   be   desig-
nated, but this  alternate  may  not  add  his  Mil-
itary Scientist Rank.  If  there  is  any  doubt  as
tO who  is  the  current  leader  of  a  party,  the
GM resolves the dispute.

     A figure's Initiative Value is  equal  to  his
modified        Agility+Perception+Rank         with
any  prepared  weapon.  If   the   figure   has   no
prepared  weapon,  it  is  equal  to  his   modified
Agility+Perception.     In     each      engagement,
the figure with the  highest  Initiative  Value  may
act  either  first  or  last,  at  his  option.  All
others  must  act  in  order  of  their   Initiative
Value, from highest to lowest.

     If a  figure  is  Stunned,  or  has  any  rear
hex    toward    his    opponent,    the    opponent
automatically receives the Initiative.
     Every    character,    NPC,    and     monster
should  have  its  Initiative  Value  for  all   the
weapons  or  attack  forms   determined   prior   to
the  adventure   and   recorded   (for   characters,
on their Character Record),
d387 9
a395 14
     Further  judgment  must   be   made   by   the
GM as  to  the  intent  of  each  figure.  For  pur-
poses   of   determing   Initiative   Values,   each
figure  should  be  compared  only  to  other   fig-
ures  who  are  involved  in  the  same  combat,  or
who  mutually  mean  each  other   harm   (see   ii-
lustration).

     Engagements  are  defined  to   allow   swift,
unambiguous    resolution    of    combat     situa-
tions.The    GM    resolves    each     engagement's
combat  separately,  and  deal  with   the   indivi-
dual  engagements  in  any  order  he   finds   con-
venient.

     Thus,  if  a  figure  chose  to  move   during
the last Pulse, it  is  assumed  to  be  moving  for
all   purposes   of   determining   combat   modifi-
ers, affects, etc.

\subsection{Actions of Engaged Figures}
d415 2
a416 16
     Being   engaged   imposes   certain    limita-
tions on the actions which a figure may     at-
tempt.  A  figure  who  is  engaged  is  defined  as
one who is adjacent  to  a  hostile  figure  on  the
display,   and   may   have   his    movement    and
choice of action restricted.

     The order  in  which  the  actions  of  engag-
ed  figures  are  resolved  is  determined  by  each
figure's   Initiative   Value,   and   any   actions
taken     by    engaged       figures    are      not
simultaneous.

     Two  or  more   hostile   figures   who   occupy
the  same  hex  are   in   Close   combat   and   are
considered engaged.
d422 9
a430 12
     If the  figure  who  wishes  to  make  t'ne  at-
tack  is  within  the  defender's  Melee   Zone,   he
may   move   only   one   hex   within   that   Zone,
and  change  facing  prior  to  attempting  the   at-
tack.   He   may   not   move   or   change    facing
after the attack.

     If the  figure  who  wishes  to  attack  is  not
within   the   defender's   Melee   Zone,   he    may
move  up  to  1/2  of  his  TMR  either   before   or
after    executing    the    attack.    Any    facing
changes  may  be  made  only  after   the   attack.
d434 12
a445 17
     If  the  figure   who   wishes   to   Evade   is
within   the   defender's   N4elee   Zone,   he   may
move   only   one   hex   within   that   Zone    and
change   facing   one   hexside    while    exectuing
the Evade.

     If  the  figure  who  wishes  to  Evade  is  not
within   the   defender's   Melee   Zone,   he    may
     move  up  to  V2  his  TMR  and  change  facing   as
     he  sees  fit  (within  the  GM's  discretion,   see
     14.1)      while executing the Evade.
          If a  Melee  attack  is  attempted  on  a  fig-
     ure  who  is  Evading,   with   a   Ranked   weapon,
     he may be able  to  Parry  or  Riposte  (see  17.4).
          Note:  A  figure  who   is   Evading   receives
     defensive   benefits   versus   Melee   and   Ranged
     attacks (see 17.6).
d449 23
a471 34
          If  the  figure  who  wishes  to  Withdraw   is
     within   the   opponent's   Melee   Zone   and   the
     opponent  also  occupies  at  least   one   hex   of
     the   figure's   Melee   Zone,   the   figure    may
     Withdraw  by  backing  directly  into  any  of   his
     rear  hexes  but  may  not  change   facing.   While
     Withdrawing,   the   figure   may   adopt   one   of
     two    postures,     Offensive     Withdrawal     or
     Defensive  WithdrawaL  If   he   chooses   the   of-
     fensive  posture,  he  may  strike  at   his   oppo-
     nent (at a -  20  modifier  to  his  Strike  Chance)
     before  executing  the  Withdrawal.   To   adopt   a
     defensive  posture,  a  figure  must  have  a   pre-
     pared  shield  (ranked  or   unranked).   While   in
     this  posture,  he  may  interpose  the  shield  be-
     tween  himself  and  any  attack.  This  adds  2007o
     to his  Defense,  in  addition  to  any  other  mod-
     ifiers already in his favor.


     If  the  figure  who  wishes  to  Withdraw   is
within   the   opponent's   Melee   Zone   but   the
opponent  d(>cs  not  occupy  any   hexes   of   the
figure's   Melee   Zone,    he    may    move    and
change  facing  normally  (see  14.1).  Note:   Fig-
ure \#7 in the illustration on this page  is  an  ex-
ample  of  this  situation.  If  the   opponent   is
able  to  Melee  attack  the  figure,  the  opponent
automaticallv  recei\%-es  Initiative  for  the   at-
tack.  A  figure  may   Withdraw   from   one   hos-
tile  figure's  Nielee  Zone  into  another  hostile
figure's Nlelee  Zone.  If  the  figure  wishing  to
WithdraA,  does  not  occupy  a   hex   within   the
a'efender's  MeleeZone,  he  niay   move   normally.
d475 14
a488 22
     If the figure  wishing  to  Pass  is  within  a
hostile   figure's   Melee   Zone,   he   may   move
one  hex  within  that  Zone   and   change   facing
while Passing.

     If the figure wishing to  Pass  is  not  within
a  hostile  figure's  1\".elee  Zone,  he  may  move
up  to   two   hexes   and   change   facing   while
Passing.

     A  Pass  action  is  a  generic  term  for  any
non-attacking    action    a    figure    may    do.
Typical   Pass   actions   include:   preparing   an
item;  preparing  a  weapon;  putting  an  item   or
weapon   away;   picking   up   a   dropped   weapon
or  item;   mounting   or   dismounting   a   riding
beast;  loading   a   missile;   dropping   to   one
knee or prone; rising up, etc.

     All  of  these  actions  are  mutually   exclu-
sive;  that  is  no  two  can  be  attempted  during
the same Pass action.
d492 9
a500 14
     If  the  Adept  wishing  to  cast  a  spell  is
within  a  hostile  figure's  Melee  Zone,  he   may
not  move  or  change  facing,  and   if   attacked,
will  have   to   perform   a   Concentraion   Check
(see 29.5).
 
    If the Adept wishing to cast  a  spell  is  not
within  a  hostile  figure's  Melee  Zone,  he   may
change  facing  after  the  Cast   Check   is   per-
formed.

     An  Adept  \%k,ho  is  in   Close   combat   may
not  cast  a  spell,   but   may   activate   Talent
Magic (see 26.0).
d504 18
a521 25
     If  the  figure  'A-ho  wishes  to  Close   and
Grapple  is  within  the  Melee  Zone  of  the   de-
fender,  the  defender  may   attempt   to   Repulse
the  attacker's  Close  attempt.  if  the   defender
wishes  to  Repulse,  he  rolls  DIO  and   compares
the  result  to   his   Rank   with   any   Prepared
weapon. If the result  is  less  than  or  equal  to
his  Rank,  the   attacker   may   not   enter   the
defender's  hex  and  must  cease  all  action   for
that  Pulse.  If  the  result  is  above  the  Rank,
the  attacker  may  enter  the  defender's  hex  and
execute a Grapple at(ack immediately.

     If  the  figure  who  wishes   to   Close   and
Grapple  is  not  within  the  Melee  Zone  of   the
defender,  the   defender   may   not   attempt   to
repulse  the  Close   attempt   and   the   attacker
may immediately enter and Grapple.
     Figures that are  larger  than  one  hex  treat
this action dif ferently (see 22.0).

\textbf{Note:}   Any    figure    who    enters    Close
Combat   must     immediately        drop        any
Prepared   shield   and    any    Prepared    weapon
not rated for Close combat.
d526 16
a541 23
     A  Grapple  is  an  attack   in   Close   combat
against  any  figure  'A,ho  occupies  the  same  hex
as  the  attacker.  It   is   assumed   any   figures
engaged  in   Close   combat   are   rolling   around
on  the  ground,  struggling   'A,ith   each   other.
Grappling   may   only   be    attempted    with    a
weapon rated for Close combat.
 
    The  figure  who  wishes  to   Pass   while   in
Close  combat   may   take   any   Pass   action   he
,A,ishes (at the GM's discretion).

     The   figure    who    wishes    to    Withdra@@,
while  in  Close  combat  must   first   attempt   to
"break  contact."   The   figure   rolls   DIO,   and
adds his (and  any  other  friendly  figures  in  the
hex)  Physical  Strength  and  subtracts  the   total
Physical Strength  of  any  hostile  figures  in  the
hex. If the modified  result  is  10  or  above,  the
figue   may   Withdraw   into   any   adjacent    hex
and  is  assumed  to  be  prone.   In   addition   an

     A non-engaged figure is one who 1
adjacent  to  any  hostile  figure  on  the  display.
There   are   certain   minor   restrictions    which
result   from   this,   but    non-engaged    figures
may  generally  take  any  action  they   wish.   All
figures  who  are  considered  on   the   same   side
or  members  of  the  same  party  take   their   ac-
tions together  and  in  any  order  they  find  con-
venient.  In  case  of  disagreement,  the   GM   has
final  say  As  to  the  order  of  actions.  No  ac-
tions  are  considered  simultaneous,  and  all   ac-
               -engaged                         r
tions of non              figures occur af . all
the actions of engaged figures have t)een
resolved.

     The   determination   of   which    side    acts
first is resolved by the Initiative  die  ro  I  (see
12.2).
d561 54
a614 79
A   figure's   TMR   equals   the   number    of
hexes  he  may  move  in  one  Pulse,  and   he   ex-
pends  one  point  of   the   TMR   for   each   nor-
mal,    unobstructed    hex    he     enters.     For
characters  and  all  NPC'S,  this  total  is  deter-
mined  by  their  modified  Agility  (see  5.6).  For
monsters,   it   is   listed   with    their    other
characteristics in 66 through 76.

     During   movement,   a   figure    may    change
facing as it desires \\,ithin  the  judgment  of  the
GM  and   the   fellow   players.   Any   complicated
maneuver  the  figure  attempts  may  result   in   a
penalty  being  applied  by  the  GM  in   the   form
of  a  reduction  in  the  figure's  TMR   for   that
Pulse.   For   instance,   turning   three   hexsides
(180')  within  one  move   is   a   fairly   complex
maneuver.  The  GM   may   decide   if   the   figure
wishes to change  facing  to  that  degree,  i't  may
move  two  less  hexes  during  the  Pulse.  At   the
end  of   mo,.-ement,   a   figure   must   unambigu-
ously  face  one  hexside  (in  the  case  of  multi-
hex monsters, one hex vertex).

     The  TNIR  assumes  a  flat  surface  with  lit-
tle  or  no  hindrance  to  movement.   The   GM   is
allowed  to  assign  a  penalty  for   movement   at-
tempted  over  terrain   not   conducive   to   quick
traversal. In any  case,  a  figure  may  always  (if
not  Stunned,   etc.)   move   one   hex   during   a
Pulse,  no  matter  how  difficult  the   terrain.

     If a  figure  enters  the  Melee  Zone  of  any
hostile   figure,   he   must   stop   movement   but
may  change  facing.  If  in  the   midst   of   exe-
cuting  a   Charge   and   Close   action,   he   may
then  be  able   to   enter   the   defender's   hex,
2epe@@aing  on   the   results   of   the   defender's
Kepulse attempt.

     1;  a  figure  wishes  to   jump   during   his
mov@@ment,   the   GM   may   allow   this   with    a
penalty  of  one  hex  for  every   5   feet   jumped
(horizontally   or   vertically)   and    make    the
figure  who  jumped  attempt  a   roll   versus   his
Agility  (with   an   appropriate   difficulty   fac-
tor) to see if he landed cleanly.

     Often t@@,o  (or  more)  friendly  figures  will
wish  to  pass  through  a  hex  at  the  same  time,
OT  need  to  squeeze  past  another  figure  in  the
same  hex.   The   GM   must   judge   whether   cir-
cut@@tances  will   allow   or   prevent   the   move,
ana if it  is  hindered,  to  what  degree.  Thus,  a
halting  should   be   able   to   squeeze   past   a
human   without   too   much   trouble,    but    for
one  human  to  move   through   a   hex   containing
another  human  will  result  in  at  least   a   TMR
penalty  of  two  hexes,  and  possibly   be   disal-
lowed  if  the  human   is   currently   engaged   in
some  fairly  active  situation  (such   as   prepar-
ing a bow to be fired).

     A figure may crawl at a  rate  of  1/4  of  his
TMR (round all fractions down).

\textbf{Note:}   Giant   characters   have   their   TMR
calcu'lated  according   to   the   monster   section
pertaining  to  them  (70.  1).  The  average  TN   R
listed is  used  as  the  midpoint  of  a  chart  the
GM creates similar  to  the  one  in  5.6,  with  the
appropriate     giant's     TMR     replacing     the
avera  e  human   TMR   of   5,   with   modification
ov g
ab  e  and  below  that  occurring   in   a   similar
manner  according  to   modified   Agility   as   for
humans.  Thus,  a  Cloud   Giant   with   a   modifi-
ed  Agility  of  19  has  a  TMR   of   14   (average
TMR of 13 + I foragility = 14).

     If  a  figure  who  is  evading   while   moving

     A  figure  may  not  move   or   change   facing
in  the  same  Pulse  as  a  weapon  is  Fired  or  a
spell  is  loosed,  with  two  exceptions:  (1)  once
a  crossbow  is  prepared  and   loaded,   a   figure
may  carry   it   around   and   fire   whenever   he
wishes.  In  this  instance,  movment  of  up  to   2
hexes prior to or after firing  is  allowed.  (2)  If
an  Adept  or   his   mount   is   flying   and   the
Adept is  in  all  other  ways  eligible  to  cast  a
spell  (has  his  hands   free,   is   not   out   of

plies to all flying magic-using monsters.

     Only   targets   who   occupy   one   or    more

     Normally   figures   occupying   the    Tactical
Display  may  only  attempt   one   permissible   ac-
tion  per  Pulse.  Figures  with  a  modified  Agili-
ty of 8 or less  are  restricted  in  the  amount  of
movment   they   may   combine   with    other    ac-
tions.  Figures  with  a  modified  Agility   of   22
or   above   gain   extra   movment   and   may    be
able  to  combine  two  actions  in  one   Pulse.

     Figures   who   become   stunned    or    other-
wise  incapacitated  will  have   their   choice   of
actions  drastically  curtailed.  The  type  of   at-
tack  a  figure  may  attempt   against   a   hostile
figure is limited by  his  position  on  the  display
,Iative to the  hostile  figure  and  the  degree  of
visibility which exists.

restrictions   and   may   in   some    circumstances
be impossible.

a hostile  fipure  who  occupies  a  hex  whch  is
obscured (due  to  smoke,  magic,  etc.),  he  may
attempt to strike if he first rolls less  than  or
equal  to  four  times  his  Perception  on  DIOO.
If the roll is above this result, the  attack  may
not  take  place  and  the  figure  may  take   no
other action that Pulse.

     This   check   may   need    to    be    done twice,
once  while   Preparing   the   spell   and   once
before Loosing it.  If  either  check  results  in
the  Adept's  concentration  being   broken,   the
spell may not  be  cast.  No  spell  work  of  any
kind  is  allowed  in  Close  combat,  but  Talent
Magic may  be  activated  at  any  time  and  does
not  require  expenditure  of  a  Pass  action  to

     A  hostile  figure   may   be   attacked   by
Ranged,  Melee,  or  Close  combat  while  on  the
display. To  attack  via  Ranged  combat,  a  fig-
ure  must  be  armed  with   a   Prepared   weapon
rated  for  Ranged  combat  and  the  target  must
occupy at least one  hex  of  the  figure's  Rang-
ed  Zone.  To  attack  via   Melee   combat,   the
figure   must   be   armed   with    a    prepared
weapon   rated   for   Melee   combat   and    the
@@rget  must  occupy  at  least  one  hex  of  that
rigure's  Melee  Zone.   To   attack   via   Close
combat,  the  figure  must   be   armed   with   a
prepared  weapon  rated  for  Close   combat   and
share the same  hex  as  the  target.  Note:  Emp-
ty   bare   hands   are   always   considered    a
prepared weapon.

     The  order  of  all  attacking   actions   is
determined by  the  Initiative  procedure  as  de-
tailed  in  12.2  and   12.3.   Combat   involving
engaged  figures  is  always  resolved  prior   to
any   combat   involving   non-engaged    figures.
An  attacker's  weapon  is   always   assumed   to
be held in  his  Primary  hand  (see  6.2)  unless
he states  otherwise.  Optionally,  a  figure  may
attempt  to  use  two  weapons  at  once,  or  at-
tempt to strike more  than  one  target  with  one
weapon.

     Special types of  attacks  are  allowed,  and
these  include  attempting  to   Trip,   Entangle,
Restrain,    Knockout,     Shield     Rush,     or
Disarm.

     To fire a  weapon,  the  attacker  must  have
a Line  of  Fire  (see  9.0)  to  the  target.  In
addition, the  attacker  may  fire  into  but  not
through  an  obscured  hex.   The   weapon   fired
always travels in a  straight  line,  and  if  not
stopped by striking  an  object,  it  will  travel
1.5 times the range of  the  weapon  and  fall  to
the ground.

     Whenever a fired  weapon  enters  a  hex  oc-
cupied by a  figure  (other  than  a  solid  wall.
tree, or pillar  which  automaticallv  breaks  the
weapon),  there  is  a  chance   the   weapon   wi
hit the figure instead of continuing  its  flight.
The  @@eapon's  flight  is  always   stopped   whe,
it strixes a figure and  remains  in  that  figure
until withdrawn.

     A Strike  Check  must  be  resolved  for  all
figures  occupying  any  hex  along  the  Line  of
Fire until the weapon  hits  something,  or  loses

     A  fivure  may  attempt  to  strike  one   or
more targets  more  than  once  as  part  of  the
same  attack  with  two  different  weapons  (one
in each hand),  but  suffers  a  negative  attack
modifier (see 17.6).  The  attacks  need  not  be
directed at the same  hostile  figure,  but  must
be  of  the  same  type   (Grapple,   Melee,   or
Fire).   Some   non-humanoid    monsters    could
attack 3, 4, or more times  in  one  Pulse  using
this option.

     A  figure  may   attempt   to   strike   more
than one carget one time  each  if  the  prepared
weapon is Class B and  the  attacker  is  Rank  4
or  above  with  the  weapon.  Each  figure  thus
attacked must be in  adjacent  hexes  within  the
attacker's  Melee   Zone.   Thus,   the   maximum
number of attacks available via  this  option  is
three.  This  attack  mav  only  occur  in  Melee
Combat,  and  the  attacker  suffers  a  negative
attack modifier (see 17.6).

  The  attacker  must  be   armed   with   a
Quarterstaff,   Spear,   Halberd,   Poleaxe,   or
Glaive  and  be  in  Melee   Combat.   The   Base
Chance is 40'7o and the damage  is  DIO.  If  the
attack is successful,  the  target  must  attempt
to roll  less  than  or  equal  to  3  times  his
modified Agility. If the target's Agility roll is
successful, he keeps his footing; if he fails the
roll, he falls prone.  This  only  works  against
human size or smaller targets.

  The  attacker  must  be   armed   with
a  Net,  Whip,  or  Bola.  The  Base  Chance   is

   A   figure   may    attempt    to    restrain

     successful  attack  results   in   the   hostile   figure
     being    restrained    (pirned).    The    Base    Chance
     equals    the    Physical    Strength    plus    modified
     Agility   of   the   attacker    minus    the    Physical
     Strength   plus   modified   Agility   of   the   target,
     times  3.  No  damage  is   done   to   the   target.   A
     restrained   figure   is   treated   as    incapacitated,
     and   remains    restrained    until    the    hold    is
     broken   by   an   attack   from    outside    the    hex
     which   does   at   least   one   point   of    effective
     damage   to   the   restrainer.   Several   figures   may

mav  be   modified   due   to   weapon   skills,   attack
type,   posture   of   the   combatants,    defense    of
the   target,   etc.   The   Base   chance    with    all
modifiers    applied    is    the     Modijied     Strike
Chance.  The  attacker  rolls   D]OO;   if   the   result
is  less  than  or   equal   to   the   Modified   Strike
Chance,    the    attack     has     been     successful;
above  and  the  attack  has   missed.   Rolling   a   99
may   result   in   the   A-eapon   being   broken    and
rolling   100   may   result   in   the   weapon    being
dropped.    Once    a    successful    hit    has    been
made, a Damage Check is conducted.

     If  the  target   is   E\'ading,   the   attacker   suf-
fers  a  negative   modifier   to   his   Strike   Chance

     To   attack   with    any    unranked    weapon,    the

     Chance    unmodified.    The    Strike    Chance     of
     either  a   Ranked   or   unranked   attack   will   be
     further modified (see 17.6).

          In  any  natural  attack  form   such   as   teeth,
     claws,  etc.,   for   monsters,   their   Manual   Dex-
     terity plus  4  times  Rank  (if  any)  is  always  ad-

     the  attacker's  weapon.  If  the  result   is   3   or

     thrown  off   balance   and   must   execute   a   Pass
     action  next  Pulse.  If  the  modified  result  is   4
     through   7,   the   attacker   has    been    Disarmed
     per the attack of the same name (see 16 .     5).      1      f
     the  niodified  result  is  8  or  above,  the   attack

          A  figure's  Defense   Rating   is   subtracted
     from   an    attacker's    Strike    Chance.    The
     defense of a shield  is  a  function  of  the  Rank
     the target has with  the  individual  shield  types
     (sec  Shield  Chart).  Thus,  a   figure   with   a
     modified Agility of  13  and  Rank  3  \%ith  shield
     carrying  a  Large  Round  Shield  has  a   Defense
     Rating of [ 1 3 + (3 x 407o)) = 2507o, and this  is
     subtracted  from   any   attacks   coming   through
     any of  the  figure's  Melee  Zone  hexes.  If  the
     attack comes  through  any  of  the  figure's  rear
     hexes, the addition of the shield  defense  is  ig-
     nored,  but  the  modification  for   Agility   re-
     mains in effect.

          Optionally,  the   shield   defense   may   only
     be  included  for  attacks   which   come   through
     the target's front  hex  and  the  hex  facing  the
     side of  the  target  in  which  the  shield  would
     actually  be  carried  (normally  in  the  target's
     secondary hand).

     The   Defense   Rating    is    not    subtracted
from  any  attacks  if  the  defending  figure   is
Stunned  or   incapacitated.   Also,   anv   shield
defense  is   ignored   for   Close   combat.   Any

figure.  Armor   may   absorb   some   or   all   of   the
damage   up   to   the    armor's    Protection    Rating,
and   any   damage   points   not   absorbed    are    in-
fl . icted    on    the    figure    and    subtracted     from
either    Fatigue     or     Endurance.     Any     damage
points  actually  inflicted  on  the   figure   (not   ab-
sorbed     by     armor)     are     termed      Effective
Damage.

     There   are   three   types    of    damage    possible
from   a   successful    strike,    depending    on    how
low   the   attacker   rolled   on    the    Strik@@.Check:
Damage     affecting      Fatigue;      affecting      En-
durance;     and     Grievous     Injury.     When     th6
Strike   Chance   result   is   above   15070    of    the
Modified      Strike      Chance,      any       effective
damage     is     subtracted     from     Fatigue     (En-
durance   when    Fatigue    reaches    0).    When    the
Strike  Chance  is  15"7o  or   less   of   the   Modified
Strike    Chance,    any    damage    directly     affects
Endurance    and    is    not    absorbed    by     ar@@?r-
If  it  is  507o  or   less   of   the   Modified   S!ri@@e
Chance,   a   Grievous   Injury   may   also.resuit,    in
addition    to    Endurance    damage.     Triese     per-
centages     are     summarized     on     the     Special

Damage Chart (I 8.2).
     Any      Damage      Checks      modified       to       a
result less than I are treated as 1.

\subsubsection{Damage affecting Fatigue is absorbed by armor.}

     Each type of     armor      has      a      Protection
Rating,     w@@ich     indicates     the     amount      of
damage points subtracted       from       every       suc-
cessful        attack.      When      a       figure's       Fatigue
reaches        0,      any      further       damage       affecting
Fatigue is          subtracted      from      EnduraRce.       n-
stead.   However,   a   figure   cannot   lose    1-ati@@@@e
and  Endurance  as   a   result   of   a   single   StriKe
Check.

Rolf     is     wearing      Leather      ar-
mor   (Protection   Rating   of   4)   -has   3    Fatigue
Points    remaining.     An     attack     against     him
results  in   9   total   damage   points.   The   Leather
absorbs   4   of   those,   and   normally   the   remain-
ing 5 would be subtracted from Fatigue '             But,
since  he   only   has   3   Fatigue   Points   left,   @@e
loses  3   Fatigue   Points   and   the   rest   are   ig-
nored  entirely.   Ifany   further   attacks   result   in
damage    being    subtracted    from     Fatigue,     the
Leather   would   still   'absorb   4   points   of   that
damage,   but    any    remaining    points    would    be
subtracted from Endurance instead.

     The   Shield   Chart   lists   all    types    of    armor
and     their     Protection     Ratings.      The      GM

     If     a     possible     Grievous      Injury      has
resulted,   the   damage    to    Endurance    is    first
calculated    and    applied.    The     attacker     then
rolls   DIOO   and   consults    the    Grievous    Injury
Table.   If   the   roll   falls   \%\%-ithin   the    range
specified  for  the   class   ofweapon   he   is   attack-
ing   with,   a   Grievous   Injury   has   resulted   and
the  effects  of  the  resulti:ng  i'nj'ury  are   applied
to   the   unfortunate   target   immediately.   If    the
roll   falls   outside    the    indicated    range,    no
Grievous Injury occurs.

     Weapons     are     classed     on      the      Weapons
Chart   (see   20.2)   accordin.-   to   type:   thrusting
weapons   are    Class    A;    slashing    weapons    are
r-Ilass   B;   and   crushing   weapons   are   Class   C.
The  Grievous  Injury   Table   lists   the   ranges   for
each   class   of   weapon.   A    figure    mav    suffer
any    number    ofgrievous    Injuries    in     a'Pulse.

     Whenever   a   figure    suffers    a    Grievous    In-
jury,   there   is   a   possibility   he   has    dropped
whatever   he    is    holding,    and    the    procedure
outlined  in  17.3  is  used  to   resolve   this   occur-
ence.

     A    figure    who    suffers    a    Grievous    inj'urv
while     wearing     armor     has     the     Protection
Rating  of  that  suit  of  armor   reduced   by   2   un-
til  repaired.  Optionally,   a   fieure   who   is   also
I-arrying   a   shield   can   choose    to    have    the
shield  clo,,,en   and   spare   his   armor.   A   cloven
shield is useless.
d1138 13
a1150 19
     Many   spells   attack   fieures   with purely
magical    energy,    while    others    inflict    damage
as   a    result    of    changes    in    the    physical
surroundings  of   the   target   (,A   indstorms,   fall-
ing  rocks,  and  the   like).   'A'hen   purely   magical
energy  is  inn,olved,   any   dama2e   result   is   sub-
tracted   from    Fatigue    (never    Ifndurance),    but
is    not    absorbed    by    armor.     Other     damage
types   are   also   subtracted    from    Fatigu,,    but
armor will absorb this damaize.

     When     being      attacked-      by      the      breath
weapon  of   a   monster,   treat   the   damage   as   if
magical   energy,    as    above,    but    allow    every
tarj-zet  a  Passive   resistance   roll   before   apply-
ing   the   damage.   If   the   target   does   Passively
resist,   the   damage   is   halved   (round    fractions
down). No    Active    resistance     is     allowed     versus
               breath attacks.
d1155 19
a1173 29
     If   using   this   rule,   add   I    to    the    damage
modifier   of   a   weapon   for   every   5   points   of
Physical      Strength       above       the       minimum
     necessary  to  wield  the   weapon   the   attacker
     possesses.  Thus,  a   figure   with   PS   of   20
     through   24   would    do    D+5    damage    when
     wielding   a   Broadsword.   However,   for   everv
     +  I  of  damage  the  figure  receives,  an  extra
     64Vo  is  added  onto  the  chance  of  the  weapon
     breaking   during   combat.   The   above    figure
     ith  the  PS  of2Owould  havea  chance   Eo   break
     w the Broadsword on  rolls  of  93  through  99,  in-
     clusive.  This   increase   in   breakage   chances
     precludes    anv    Modified     Strike     Chances
     which  would  conflict  with  it.  Thus,   it   the
     above  figure  had   a   Modified   Strike   Chance
     of 9707o, it would actually be  9207o  since  rolls
     of 93-99 would  result  in  a  possible  break  and
     100 would result in  a  possible  drop.  This  does
     not   apply   to   Thrown   or   Missile   Weapons.

           If  wishing  to  allow   increased   damage   for
     bonus  for  every  4  Ranks  (round   down).   This
     Rank  attained   with   a   weapon,   give   a   +1
     rule  will  increase  damage  do\%,,-n  by  Thro\%k-n
     or  Missile  Weapons,   and   does   not   increase
     breakage   chances.   lt   is   recommended   onIN-
     one  of  these  systems  be  used  with  any   on'e
     r)articular \%N,eapon, not both.
d1179 27
a1205 38
          The   ultimate   result   of   incurring    damage
     for any figure is  death;  this  arrives  when  the
     figure's    Endurance    reaches    0.    When    a
     figure's  Endurance  reaches  3,   he   falls   un-
     conscious, and can  only  be  revived  by  time  or
     the arts of a Healer.

          . Whenever    a     figure     suffers     effective
     damage  greater   than   one-third   his   original
     Endurance  from  a  single  strike,   he   becorres
     Stunned.  The  figure  may  not  take   any   other
     action  except  attempt  to   recover   from   Stun
     until he  has  reco\%-ered.  A  figure  who  becomes
     Stunned  may   drop   anything   he   is   holding.
     (The  procedure  outlined  in  17.3  is   used   to
     resolve  the  outcome.  The  check  is  only   per-
     formed   once,   at   the   moment    the    figure
     becomes Stunned.)

          A     Stunned     figure     who     is     engaged
     automatically  has  the  lowest  Initiative   Value
     of   the   engagement;   an    unengaged    Stunned
     figure acts the last of all his fellows.

          To   recover   from   being   Stunned,   a   figure
     must roll less  than  or  equal  to  his  Willpower
     plus his current Fatieue.

          Current   Facieue   is   the    fieure's    Fatigue
     iotal at  the  instant  the  roll  is  made.  Every
     Pulse   after   becoming   Stutnned,   the   figure
     may  a,,empt  to  recover  bu   mav   do   nothing-
     else, including mo\%,e

          Note:    Certain    monsters    begin    with    an
     Endurance  of  5  or  less.  These  monsters  never
     become   unconscious;   they   are   either   alive
     and alert, Stunned, or dead.

a1228 29
          Any   instrument    used    to    inflict    damage
     on a figure  is  called  a  weapon.  N@@'eapons  mav
     include  the   fieure's   hands,   claws,   talons'
     feet,  teeth,  breath  weapon,  etc.   All   normal
     weapons   are   listed   on   the   Weapons   Charl
     along  with   their   characteristics.   The   only
     iiits  to  the  number  of  weapons   a   character
     may have in  his  possession  are  the  weight  and
     bulk   of   those   Aeapons.    The    GM    should
     carefully   examine   each   character,    checking
     for  the  location  of  the  character's   weapons.
     Any   odd   or   unlikely   method    of    carting
     weaponry   around   should   be   disallowed.   Any
     humanoid   figure   may-never   ha\%,e   more   than
two  one-handed  weapotis  or   one   two-handed
weapon prepared at  any  one  time.  Carrying  a
prepared   shield   replaces   one    one-handed
weapon  and  disallows   a   two-handed   weapon
for this purpose. Figures with more  than  t\%\%'o
appendages  may   use   as   manv   weapons   as
they are able. It is  al'A'ays  assumed  when  a
figure is armed 'A,ith a  one-handed  weapon  it
is carried in his  primary  hand  unless  stated
otherwise.

     A  figure  may  attempt  to  envenom  any  A
or B Class weapon and  thus  poison  the  figure
it strikes. An assassin is trained in the use of
envenomed weapons (see 20.3).

     A  figure  may  attempt  to   strike   bare-

tempt to use an item  not  normally  assumed  to

     All   normal   weapons   which   would   ap-
pear   within   a   common   DragonQuest   world
are detailed on the chart. If the GM  wishes  to
add  more  exotic  weapons  to  the   list,   he
should  feel  free   to,   and   should   assign
characteristics  for  those  weapons  based   on
the  examp!es  given.  The  characteristics  for
each weapon are:

pounds (or ounces, if so noted).
d1252 29

\item[Physical   Strength]   The   minimum    Physical
Strength-a figure  needs  to  wield  the  weapon
properly; a figure without the PS to  meet  this
minimum  does  one  less  point  of  damage  for
each  point  of  strength  he   is   below   the
minimum.  A  figure  may  ne\%,er  achieve   Rank
in a weapon he does not have the  PS  to  wield.

\item[Manual   Dexterity]   The   minimum    modif,,ed
Manual Dexterity a  figure  needs  to  maneu\,er
the  weapon  properly;  a  figure  without   the
MD  to  meet   this   minimum   has   the   Base
Chance of the weapon  lowered  by  5  for  everv
point he is below the mini,-num.  A  figure  mav
never achieve Rank  in  a  weapon  he  does  not
have the MD to maneuver.

\item[Base  Chance]  The  base   percentage   of   the
Weapon to score a successful hit on a figure.

\item[Damage   Modifier]   The   number    added    to
the DIO  die  roll  then  peforming  a  Damaee
Check; the modified  total  may  never  be  less
than 1.

\item[Range]  The  distance   (expressed   in   hexes)
which the weapon may be Fired.

\item[Class]  A  letter  representing  the   type   of
damage  done  by  the  weapon.  A  weapons  do
thrusting  damage.   B   weapons   do   slashing
damage.   C   weapons   do   crushing    damage.
Used for determining Grievous Injuries,

\item[Use] A letter representing the 1),pe(s)  of  at-
tack the weapon may  be  used  in.  R  indicates
Ranged  combat.  M   indicates   Melee   combat.
C  indicates  Close  combat.  A   'A,eapon   may
not be used in an attack type for  which  it  is
not rated.

chase  the  weapon.  At  the  cost  listed,   the
weapon is of normal quality.

\subsection{Figures may, at the GM's discretion, employ envenomed weapons.}
d1291 22
a1312 34
     If the GM permits, figures may          carry
and use weapons coated with poison.          Only
Class  A  and  B  weapons   may   be   envenomed.
See the Alchemist skill  for  details  concerning
types  of  poisons  and  paralysants.   For   the
venom  to  be  introduced  into  the  bloodstream
of the victim, at  least  I  point  of  effective
damage must be done.

     When   anyone   but   an   Assassin   handles
an  envenomed  weapon,  there  is  a  chance  the
figure  will  nick  himself  and  introduce   the
venom  into  his  own  bloodstream.  Every   time
an  envenomed  weapon  is  handled,  the   figure
must try to roll less than or equal  to  3  times
his  modified  Manual  Dexterity   on   D]OO   to
avoid any mishap. If the  roll  is  greater  than
his  MD,  he  has  been  nicked  by  the   weapon
and is poisoned.  Handling  a  weapon  is  defin-
ed  as  including  all  actions  of  coating  the
weapon  with  the  venom,  storing   the   weapon
until  use,  and  preparing  the  wcapon  for  the
attack.  The  check  should  be  made   oncc   for
the  preparation  of  the  weapon  and  once   for
the attack. The timing of  the  checks  is  up  to
the GM,  but  two  rolls  should  always  bc  made
if the weapon is used  to  attack.  Cleansing  the
weapon  of  the  poison   does   not   require   a
check.   An   envenomed   weapon    will    remain
effective  for  6  hours,  by   which   time   the
venom  will  have   evaporated   or   been   wiped
off.   When   the    weapon    has    successfully
struck and done I  or  more  points  of  effective
damage, the venom has been removed.
d1317 10
a1326 15
     Whenever   a   figure   suffers   effective
damage  from  a  Class  A  Missile   or   Thro\\%,n
weapon, it  has  lodged  itself  in  the  target's
body  and  reduces   his   Agility   by   3.   The
weapon remains  lodged  until  a  Pass  action  is
executed   to   remove   it.   When   any   barbed
weapon  is  removed  (arrow,  spear,  etc.),   the
figure takes D - 4  damage  to  Fatigue  (not  ab-
sorbed  by  armor).  If  the  weapon  is  a   Pole
weapon, the Agility  loss  is  5  and  the  damage
to remove it is D - 2.

     The  Agility  loss   applies   only   to   man-
sized  or  smaller  figures.  The   GM   must   judge
the Agility loss for larger figures.
d1329 1
d1331 20
a1350 33
     Any   figure   may   attempt   to   attack    a
hostile figure by  using  his  hands  and  feet.  For
many  monsters,  this  is  the  only  way  they   may
attack.    Unless    specified     otherwise,     all
figures/monsters    receive    one    attack     with
their    hands/claws/bite    per    Pulse     without
penalty.  Some  monsters   may   be   able   to   at-
tack  more   than   once,   and   these   individuals
are  detailed  in  the  Monsters  Section  (VI   11).

     For  a  humanoid  figure  to  strike  with  his
primary  hand,   the   Base   Chance   is   (modified
Agilityx2).   For   every    point    the    figure's
Physical   Strength   is   above   15,    the    Base
Chance  is  increased   by   1.   The   damage   done
by a successful  strike  is  D  -  4,  with  I  extra
point    of    damage    for    every    3     points of
Physical  Strength   above   15.   A   humanoid   can
achieve  Rank  with  bare  hands  just  as   he   can
with any weapon.

     Beginning at Rank   3    in    Unarmed    Com-
bat,  figures  may  choose   to   kick   insteadofus-
ing hands (or in addition to hands) in unarm-
ed  attack.   This   allows   an   unarmed   attack
while  a  figure's  hands  are   full.   The   Base
Chance  and  damage  are  as  above.   Using   legs
in this manner allows an attempted Trip . y
the attacker (see  16.5)  with  Base  Cha,,,e  a  d
damage  remaining  the  same  as  for  all   unarm-
ed combat.

22.  MULTI-HEX  MONSTERS
d1354 26
a1379 39
     Many  monsters   detailed   in   the   Monsters
Section  (VIII)  will  occupy  more  than  one  hex
on  the  Tactical  Display.  Their   size   necces-
     sitates the following  alterations  in  the  resolu-
     tion of movement and combat.

          Multi-hex  monsters   have   three   types   of
     hexes   surrounding   them:   Front,    Rear,    and
     Flank.  Front  and  Rear  hexes  function   in   the
     same  way  for  them  as  for  any   other   figure,
     but  attacks  through  Flank   hexsides   give   the
     attacker  a  bonus  (see  17.6).  The   exact   con-
     figuration  of  Front,   Rear,   and   Flank   hexes
     vary with the size of  the  monster  (see  illustra-
     tion).

          A   multi-hex   monster    must    always    be
     placed  on  the   display   such   that   its   head
     unambiguously   faces   a   vertex   of   two   hex-
     sides. It may move in  any  way  so  that  its  head
     enters any  Front  hex,  and  may  move  up  to  its
     full  TMR  in  this  fashion.  At  the  end  of  its
          ovement,   it   must   once   again    unambiguous-
     iy face a vertex.  For  facing  changes,  a  penally
     of one  less  hex  of  movement  for  each  two  hex
     e tices  changed  is   applied,   since   the   mass
     i)eing   maneuvered   is   much   greater   than   a
     humanoid's.  In  order   to   change   facing,   the
     monster must pivot  using  its  head  as  the  pivot
     point.

A  multi-hex  monster  may   freely   pivot   or
     7iove into any hex occupied by a I-hex
     figure. The smaller figure is knocked prone
     automatically  and  the  monster   may   then   at-
     tempt to  trample  the  figure  at  a  Base  Chance
     of  4007o,  doing  (DIO+size  of  the  monster   in
     exes)    damage.    Trampling    is     Class     C
                   aamage.

          in mounted combat, the TMR of     the
     figure  (comprising  the  mount  and   the   rider)
     is that of  the  mount;  the  rider  may  not  move
at  all.  A  rider  may  only  mount   or   dismount
when  the  mount  is  not  moving.  Any   action   a
figure  is  capable  of  while   standing   on   the
ground  he  is  capable   of   while   moun(ed   wih
the  following  exceptions:  (1)  using   a   t'A-0-
handed   weapon;   (2)   firing   any   missile   or
thrown  weapon  while   moving;   (3)   using   more
than  one  weapon  at  a  time.  These  restrictiors
are   lifted   depending   on    the    Horsemansh;-
Rank of the rider (see 83.2). A figure m
always  use  a  shield  and  a  one-handed  weapor',
while mounted.

The horseman with  the  sword  can  attack  into  hcx
A or hex C, but not into heX B. Thus, the figure  or.
foot cannot be hit with the sword, but  he  could  be
trampled.

     A  rider  and   mount   will   normally   occupy
only  one  hex,  unless  the  mount  is  a  multi-hex
monster.  If  they  occupy   more   than   one   hex,
the  movement  will  be  governed   biy   the   rules
of  multi-hex  monsters  (see  22).   On   a   normal
mount, the rider will  not  be  able  to  attack  out
of his Front hex, only the hexes to either  side
of that hex.  His  Front  hex  may  be  attacked
into using  a  spear  (or  similar  long  hafted
weapon) or any Fired weapon (see  illustration).

     To  control  a  mount  during  combat,   the
Horsemanship skill of the rider  is  taken  into
account.   An   inexperienced   horseman    will
have an  incredibly  difficult  time  even  con-
trolling his mount in a chaotic melee;  it  will
be @@,etter for him  to  dismount  and  fight  on
foot until hc becomes skilled.

     A Charge on  a  mount  is  executed  in  the
same manner as  a  Charge  on  foot  except  the
amount of movement  prior  to  the  attack  will
be  greater  and  the  Charge  must  be   in   a
straight line (no facing changes allow         1.
Any act of turning the mount or stopping it
during or after the Charge will require a
Horsemanship  Check  (see   82.2).   The   Pulse
following  any  mounted   Charge,   the   momen-
tum will take the mount past the target to  its
full TMR. Any  attempt  to  turn  or  stop  the
mount will occur after that  movement  is  ter-
minated. A failed  check  will  result  in  the
mount continuing on its way.

     At the end  of  every  combat  in  which  a
figure  is  wounded,  or  when  a   figure   is
wounded in a  non-combat  situation,  there  is
the possibility  that  figure  has  become  in-
fected as a result of his wound.  An  Infection
Check   must   be   performed   to    determine
whether he is infected or not.

     The Base Chance of infection  is  equal  to
1001o. If the figure took  any  damage  to  En-
durance, add (20  +  the  amount  of  Endurance
damage  in  points).  If  the  damage  was  in-
flicted by bite,  claws,  or  talons,  add  20.

Specific Grievous Injuries  may  raise  the  Base
Chance  even   further.   The   infected   figure
rolls DIOO; if the result  is  greater  than  the
modi@@  Base  Chance,  the  figure  is   not   in-
fected; if the result is equal to or  less  than,
the rigurc is infected.

     An infected  figure  is  considered  diseas-
ed,  and  every  morning   after   becoming   in-
fected, the figure must try to  heal  himself  or
suffer  Endurance  damage.  To  heal  himself,  a
figure  ires  to  roll  under  his  original  En-
durance on DIOO; a roll equal  to  or  less  than
the Endurance results in a cure.  If  the  infec-
tion is not cured,  each  day  the  figure  takes
DIO-5   (minimum   result   of    1)    Endurance
damage from  the  infection.  Obviously,  an  in-
fected figure who is not  cured  will  eventually
die from his wounds.  The  effects  of  slow  ac-
ting  (blood  agent)  poisons  function  in   the
same manner as  infections  except  there  is  no
roll for cure.

by  foot  along  a  path  deep  within  a  forest.
They are alert  but  not  combat-ready;  thev  are
tired from  having  traveled  long  and  hard  all
day. The party consists of  Ariella,  a  Celestial
Mage;  Eaglewing,  an  Elven  Ranger;   and,   De-
lion, an Elven Illusionist. The GIvl  has  -.ener-
ated  an  ambush  for  the  pariv  as  they  round
the next bend in the path, and  assigns  a  readi-
ness factor (see 80.2) of 3  to  their  chance  to
detect  the  ambush.  Eaglewing  is  leading   the
party, so his Perception of 10  is  used  for  the
check, but he  also  receives  a  bonus  of  1507o
due  to  his  Ranger  Rank.  Eaglewing  does   de-
tect  the  ambush,   and   the   Hobgoblin,   Orc,
and Goblin lying in  wait  will  get  no  surprise
this  day.  The  GM  determines  they   will   at-
tempt  the  attack  anyway,  and  combat   begins.

     The   GM   draws   out    the    surroundings,
places the  characters'  miniatures  on  the  Dis-
play,  and  then  places  the  monsters'  figures.
He  determines  the   characters'   Fatigue   loss
(due  to  their  long  march),   and   adjudicates
the  monster's  Fatigue  status.  He  allows   the
characters to prepare a  weapon,  if  thev  wish,
because of thealertness ofeaelewing.

\subsubsection{First   Pulse}

    The    Hobgoblin    (Perception. of
13) is the  Leader  of  the  monsters.  Eagle\%\%'i ng
is the party's Leader. The GNI  rolls  Initiative
for  the  monsters,   and   Ea2le\%\%ing's   plaver
rolls for the  party.  The  Hob2oblin  wins  a'nd
decides that the monsters \%\%Tll  act  first.  The
Hobgoblin tries  to  goad  his  mount  (a  horse)
to   Charge   Eaglewing.   The   GM   rolls   the
Hobgoblin's Horsemanship check; it is suc-
cessful   and   the   charee   occurs.          The
Hobgoblin  is  not  close  enouzh  to   Eaplewing
at the end of  the  Charge  to  Melee  him  with
his  Scimitar.  The  Orc  throws  his  spear   at
Arielia  and  misses.  The   Goblin   fires   his
Crossbow  at  Delion  and  hits  him,  1)rofitine
from  the  +20   bonus   for   attacki@@g   Del-on
from a Rear hex.  Delion  takes  9  points  Of  I Fa-
tigue damage (4  of  which  is  absorbed  by  his
i4
LeatherArmor)andbecomesStunned.               eis

unable to hold on to his Rapier, \%\%hich falls  to
the  ground.  Now  the  partv  may  act.  Eagl,w-
ing,   having   prepared    @@is    Tulwar    upon
becoming  aware  of  the  ambush,  sets   himself
to  receive  the  Hobgoblin's  Charge  bv  taking
an  Evade  Action   (he   has   achieved'Rank   5
with the Tulwar, so  he  thinks  he  has  a  good
chance to Parry). Ariella prepares a  spell,  and
begins  to   pronounce   the   maeical   incanta-
     tions. She mav not mo'6,e. Delion  acts  last  as
     he  is   Stunn@@.   He   may   only   attempt   to
     reco, er from Stun; he tries and fails.

a1521 30
 The  Initiative   roll   is   won
     apain  by  the  Hobgoblin.  He   Charges   Eagle-
     \%\%ing  and  a(tacks.  His  Strike  Check  is   37
     abo\%,e his Modified  Strike  Chance,  so  Eagle-
     ,A ing ma@@, Parrv. He rolls an 8, plus 6 for  his
     Rank,  minus  3   for   the   Hobgoblin's   Rank,
     yields a result of  11,  a  Disarm  and  Riposte.
     Eagle,Aing   hits   the   Hobgoblin   with    his
     Riposte,   doine   damage   affecting   Endurance
     for 12 points.  The  Hobgoblin  is  Stunned,  and
     the G,\l checks to see if  he  falls  fron,.  his
     horse- He does, and falls  at  Eaglewing's  feet.
     The  Orc  prepares   his   Scimitar   and   moves
     slii-zhtlv to\%\%-ards Delion.  The  Goblin  begins
     to re-load his crossbow.

          Eagle,.\%  ing  attacks  the  prone   Hobgoblin
     (the Riposte does not count  as  an  Action),-re-
     cei\%,ing  a  +  15  for   the   Hobgoblin   being
     Stunned and a +  20  for  his  being  prone  (the
     Hob-2oblin's  Defense  is  not   subtracted   be-
     cause he is Stunned).  Eaglewing  strikes  for  a
     Grievous Injury this  Pulse  and  kills  the  un-
     fortunate Hobeoblin. Ariella tries  to  cast  her
     spell of  Starfire  (knowing  full  well  she  is
     receivine a - 20 penalty because it is still day-
     time) and  does,  doing  13  points  ofdamage  to
     the  Goblin,  \%\%-ho  becomes  Stunned  and  drops
     his bow.  Delipn  tries  again  to  recover  from
     Stun, and succeeds.

a1535 14
  This  time  Eaglewing   wins   the
     Initiative  Roll  (performed  against   the   Orc
     since the Hobpoblin is dead).  Since  no  one  is
     engaged  yet  (t@@e  Hobgoblin  does  not   engage
     Eaefewing because he  is  dead),  he  chooses  to
     ha\%e  the  party  act  first.  He  prepares   his
     \%lain-Gauche,   and   moves   slightly    towards
     the  Orc.  Ariella  begins  to  prepare   another
     Starfire.  Delion  picks  up   his   Rapier   and
     changes  facing  to  receive  the  Orc's  attack.

          ihe  Orc  mo\%-es  up  to   Delion   and   Melee
     attacks  him,  missing.   The   Goblin   recovers
     from beine Stunned.
d1539 19
a1557 29
Initiative is rolled             between
     Eaele\%\%-ine and the Goblin, since the Orc is
     eneaged   with   Delion.   Eaglewing   wins   it.
     However,  since  the  Orc  and  Delion  are   en-
     ga2,d.  their  combat  is  resolved  before  any-
     thin,-z else. The Orc's Initiative Value  is  27,
     Delion's is 2-@@, so the Orc may act first. He at-
     tacks  Delion,  inflictin-  enough  Fatigue  dam-
     age \%kith his successful attack  that  Delion  is
     out of Fatigue (remember, the  party'A  as  tired
     to be2in \%kith). Delion,  seeing  the  \%\%-ay  the
     battle is going, Withdraws defensivelv.

          Eaizlewing  chooses  to  have  the   party   act
     first and allo@@\%s Ariella to try her spell before
     he  himself  takes  anv  action.  Ariella,   how-
     ever, is not so luckv this  time  and  her  spell
     backfires,  reducing  her  Fatigue   to   0   and
     Stunnine  her.  Eagle'A-ing  (frustrated  at  the
     Adept's fumblings)  moves  up  to  the  Orc,  al-
     tacking him from  behind.  He  receives  a  +  30
     r attackiniz from a Rear  hex  but  a  -  15  for
     fo
     Charging  ,\%ith  a  non-Pole  weapon.   His   at-
     tack  is  successful,   doin-e   enough   Fatigue
     damage  to  Stun  the  Orc.  Delion  cannot   act
     now  because  because   he   has   already   per-
     formed an Action earlier in the Pulse.
     The Goblin runs awav.
