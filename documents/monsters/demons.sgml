<group name="Demons">
<notes>
Demons are possessed of certain qualities not listed in their
descriptions.  All demons exercise their skills at Rank 15 and magic
powers at Rank 20.  Demons are not subject to specific Grievous
Injuries.  Instead, they suffer Endurance damage.  They can only be
harmed by magic or by silvered weapons.  Being creatures of mana, they
are not prevented from performing magic by the presence of cold iron.
A demon automatically recovers from all injury by spending one full
day in its own dimension.  Demons may choose to bring along one or
more hellhounds when summoned.

<class name="Succubi and Incubi">
<notes>
It is important to understand why Incubi and Succubi appear on this
plane at all in order to successfully GM them in a campaign.  They are
not intended to be the ``companions'' of any Adept.  Their sole
purpose is to increase the number of followers of the Powers of
Darkness on this plane.  They are representatives of this Power, and
as such, they cannot by themselves create anything.  Thus, they must
use mankind (members of both sexes) to aid in their mission.  By their
sexual activity, they seek to create children who are, in reality and
spirit, children of Darkness.

Because of their purpose, an Incubi will never kill the human he has
just mated with.  He will endeavour to keep the nature of his true
being from this woman so the child which he is trying to create will
be born and not aborted.  It is to be assumed that any mating between
Incubi and a human female will automatically result in a pregnancy
unless aborted.  For more detailed information on this subject, a good
reference is The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology by Russell
Hope Robbins (New York Crown Publishers, 1959).
