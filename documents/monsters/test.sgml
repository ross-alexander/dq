<description>These birds have dark brown plummage and thin,
unfeathered necks of a tannish color. Their beaks are black and
snub-tipped. They prey on the dead and near-dead (espcially if
unconscious).

<talents>Buzzards can see each other miles away, and thus when one
buzzard descends for a meal, others soon follow. Except for their keen
eyesight, buzzards possess no special talents, skills or magic.  They
are not tool users.

<weapons>A buzzard attacks in Close Combat with its claws and beak.
The claws' Base Chance is 45&percnt, for [D − 5] Damage, while the
bite's Base Chance is 40&percnt, for [D − 6] Damage.  A buzzard cannot
attack in Melee Combat.

other small animals from human flocks.  They will sometimes attack a
party which ventures too near their nest.
