\begin{mmgroup}{Common land mammals}

\subsection{Apes and Prehumans}
Apes and prehumans include baboons, gorillas, and orang-outangs in
addition to two classes of prehumans: neanderthals and sasquatchs.
All of these tend to be shy of humans and will usually dwell in high
mountains or deep jungle.  They have three times the stealth of an
average human (30) and are often adept at tracking and have other
talents sometimes associated with the Ranger Skill.

\subsubsection{Baboon}

\begin{description}
\item[Natural Habitat] Plains Common

\item[Number] 1–100 (2)

\item[Description] Baboons are medium-sized apes, usually no more than 4
feet tall, and 120 pounds in weight. They are characterized by their
large heads and long sharp fangs.  Baboons generally have light brown
fur, but may have brightly coloured (orange, blue, purple or red)
faces and/or rumps (especially females).

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic] Baboons possess no special talents or skills. They are
neither magic nor tool users and are only semi-intelligent.

\item[Weapons] Baboons cannot attack except in Close Combat.  They will
swarm over their victim, using their bite (Base Chance of 65\%,
Damage of +4) to kill by increasing blood loss.  Comments: Baboons
tend to be vicious and unpredictable, attacking without warning.  They
are tribal in nature and do not fear men when in company with the rest
of the tribe.  They can sometimes (30\% chance) be assuaged by
food (usually meat).

\subsubsection{Gorilla (Mountain Gorilla/Great Ape)}

\begin{description}
\item[Natural Habitat] Woods, Forest and Mountains Rare

\item[Number] 1–40 (20)

\item[Description] Gorillas reach 650 pounds and 6+ feet in height.  They
usually have arm spans when full grown of over 10 feet.  Gorillas tend
to have black fur, but older males will often have gray or silver
fur. Some species are entirely white.  Both males and females have
prominant canines and are vicious fighters.  Due to their great
weight, gorillas cannot move between trees in the manner of other
apes.

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic] Gorillas have no special talents or skills. They are not
tool or magic users.

\item[Weapons] Gorillas may only attack via Close Combat.  However, they
may enter Close Combat with an entity whose combined modified Agility
and Physical Strength is half or less their own by grabbing the victim
and pulling him into their hex.  This maneuver requires a Charge
Action and is implemented in the same manner (except that the victim
is pulled out of his hex into the gorilla's.  Gorillas may bite (Base
Chance of 30\%, [D − 2] Damage) or rend (Base Chance of
50\%, [D + 6] Damage) in Close Combat, but not in the same pulse.

\subsubsection{Neanderthal}

\begin{description}
\item[Natural Habitat] Woods, Rough, Caverns Rare

possess most Ranger skills at Ranks 1–6 (some at higher Rank).  They
will have no talents and will not be magic users. Neanderthals will
have only a limited tool using capacity and will generally not use
weapons more complicated than stones and clubs.

\item[Weapons] Neanderthals will use rocks and sticks and sometimes simple
clubs and axes.  They will rarely (15\%) pick up and use a dropped
weapon of a more complex nature.  They will be at a total loss to
figure out the workings of such complex weapons as bows.  They have
prominent canines and will always attempt to enter Close Combat where
they will bite (Base Chance of 30\%, [D − 3] Damage) in addition to
striking.

\subsubsection{Camel}

\begin{description}
\item[Natural Habitat] Waste, Plains Common

\item[Number] 1–6 (3)

\item[Description] A camel is a tawny, thin-legged creature often used as a
riding beast.  Camels will have either one large hump on their back or
two. If the latter is in the case, the camel is called a dromedary.

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic] Camels'metabolisms allow them to retain large quantities of
fat and water, so they are able to survive for long periods without
eating or drinking.  On average, a camel can live for a week to ten
days without water without suffering substantial ill effects.  While
valued for this trait, they are difficult to train and so will bring
little money in an untrained state.  Trained camels will bring 700–900
Silver Pennies.

\item[Weapons] Bite has a Base Chance of 30\% of doing [D − 1] Damage
in Melee or Close Combat.  Camels may kick instead of biting in Melee

smell and poor eyesight.

\item[Weapons] The elephant's main weapons are his tusks, which can be used
in Melee or Close Combat with a Base Chance of 15\% of doing [D +
2] Damage.  If the elephant is charging while making a tusk attack,
the Base Chance is 60\% and Damage is [D + 8]. The elephant can
also attack with his trunk during the same Pulse in which it Melee
Attacks with tusks and has a Base Chance of 80\% of doing [D − 2]
Damage.  If an elephant runs over an entity in Close Combat, he has a
Base Chance of 50\% of doing [D + 6] Damage (resolve one attack
per foot, total of 4).

 Elephants will usually shy away from humanoids unless
provoked (70\% chance that provocation short of attack will be
ignored).  If one elephant is attacked, all nearby elephants will come
to his assistance, especially if the elephant is a cow or calf.
Elephant tusks are valuable ([D + 3] Silver Pennies per pound of ivory
with each tusk weighing 100 pounds).  Calves will sell for 1000 Silver
Pennies and adult bulls will sell for three times that if unharmed.
Adult females may fetch 1500 Silver Pennies if still in their breeding
years.

\begin{mmcomment}
 Dingoes hunt in packs.  They will usually refrain from

be sold to an individual who was not present at their training.

feet in length.  Their hides are specked with large dark brown
rings. They have short tails and rounded ears.  The forelegs of a

\begin{description}
\item[Natural Habitat] Woods, Rough, Marsh Common

 Mongooses are especially valued as house pets and a
mongoose which is trained to remain in the vicinity of a dwelling (and
protect against snakes, especially cobras) will fetch 300–400 Silver
Pennies. They are relatively easy to train for this task.

\item[Natural Habitat] Caverns, Ruins, Crypts Common

\item[Number] 1–100 (12)

\item[Description] Usually about eight inches long, these animals can be
any combination of shades of black, white, or brown.  Some larger

\begin{mmcomment}
 Rats are not tool-users, but they can dig holes and gnaw
through substances as hard as sandstone and lead, given enough time.
When in combat they tend to head for the eyes and other unprotected
areas, so the armor protection Rating of characters defending against
rats should be reduced by three or four points.  A character has a
10\% chance of contracting a disease if he is in contact with
rats for any period of time. If a character is bitten by a rat,
increase chance of infection by 20.
\end{mmcomment}

\subsubsection{Weasel}

\begin{description}
\item[Natural Habitat] Woods Uncommon

\item[Number] 1–2 (1)

\item[Description] Weasels have a brown coat during the summer, which turns
white as winter approaches.  They are slim, and utterly vicious.  The
pelts of weasels taken during winter are worth 40–70 Silver Pennies
each.


\item[Talents, Skills and Magic] Weasels are the only animals which can stand the gaze and
breath of the basilisk, and thus they are often trained to kill them.
They are, however, difficult to train and a trained Basilisk killer is
worth 4,000–6,000 Silver Pennies.  Other than this special ability,
weasels have no talents or skills.  They use neither tools nor magic.

\item[Weapons] Weasels may only attack in Close Combat by biting.  Bite has
a Base Chance of 75\% of doing [D + 4] damage.
